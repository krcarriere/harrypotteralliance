Well, March of 2013, we will be building another Imagine Better Library at the UNO-Garcia Charter High School in Chicago, IL! 

This library, together with our other donation sites, including the Bedford-Stuyvesant New Beginnings Charter School in New York City, will form the beginnings of the Imagine Better Network of libraries.

Education equality starts with giving EVERY child easy access to books! With the Imagine Better network of libraries children will be able to discuss and interact with each other around the world.

Both I and the other leaders at the HPA, wanted to send this note out to let those anywhere near this storm know that our hearts are going out to you and all of your loved ones. Please be safe and take a moment to review how to respond to situations that may occur during and after a hurricane at ready.gov. Also, in the event you are in need of shelter, text SHELTER + your zipcode to 43362 to find the nearest shelter in you area.

Please expect to be hearing from us VERY soon about our upcoming campaign. And to be candid, as I sit here typing this email with the wind smashing against my house, I'm thinking we should probably take on global warming in the not too distant future!

But for now: please be safe, please enjoy being inside, and if you have a flashlights, I hope you have the opportunity to curl up with a good book.

3- If not, why not? It will take a few hours of your time and could help determine the fate of marriage equality for the fate of our nation and world. Your calls mean so much!

Our mythology has the power to wound and destroy. But it also has the power to speak deeply to us; so deeply, in fact, that we can deepen our experience as human beings and as a collective.

And such sacred power, no one owns. Yes, no one owns a story. It belongs to the world, for it came from the soul of the world. 

A story has power that must be held with love for a story can magically melt walls of our separate rooms that contain separate work: over here, the yoga studio, the therapist's office, the acupuncturist's room, the scientist's laboratory, the artist's studio. Over there: the LGBTQ meeting, the anti-poverty group, the anti-genocide group, the environmental group, the Occupy meeting, the corporate responsibility meeting. Over there: the after school, the History classroom, Social Studies, Literature. Over there: the hospice, the temple, the church, the funeral home, the maternity ward, the bed of a birthing mother, the bath of a birthing mother. Over there: the night clubs, bars, sporting stadiums, theaters, parks, hotels, hostels, conferences, tv's, computers, smart phones, radios, tablets, neighborhood, bookstores, restaurants, farmer's market.

The walls of each room that separate these dimensions come tumbling down and melt in the face of story - organize and synthesize in a unified multiverse of art, healing, activism, education and recreation, entertainment, holy sites, sites of sin - all of together as one - where billions of heroes live our journeys as separate shining stars in the sky; whose songs of suffering, joy, and separation are pulled to the extreme as a rubber band, until we pop to the other end as one unified story: one hero crying against the cross of existence, ""O, Father! Why hast thou forsaken me?"" And in the silence of that cry - the echoes and reverberations of that cry....come resurrection.""

"2990","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","Friends,

It is with a broken heart that I discuss the loss of a beloved friend, Sifa Nsengimana. She was killed in a car accident at the age of 37, leaving behind her extraordinary husband, two extraordinary children, a huge family of relatives and friends, countless orphans and genocide survivors, and our human family.

Many of you knew Sifa or knew of her while many have never heard of her. And so I should make this clear: by being part of the HPA on any level, you have been touched by Sifa. 

Sifa was our most prominent and beautiful voice for human rights over podcast/livestream/bllogging as well as a trusted advisor on our advocacy. Further, without Sifa (and her work with former HPA Board member Sarah Newberry), there would be no Accio Books. There would be no Candles For Rwanda project that we put together, that led to the HPA's first ever collaboration with John and Hank Green and Nerdfighteria. A collaboration which would eventually lead to Helping Haiti Heal/Chase grant/the ""With Esther"" video/perhaps P4A becoming a fundraiser.

For that matter, there would be no ASYV youth village in Rwanda where she was founding Executive Director (our community is only a very small part of the equivalent of what appears to be 10,000 lifetimes of work).

While the HPA is currently working on Equality FTW, it is of great importance to me that we remember our roots in the human rights movement (a movement that is in essence the same as all movements for Civil Rights). It is of great importance to me as we, this April, approach yet another anniversary of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, that we do something to honor her memory. Giving her as our creative director Acacia Ludwig referred to it as: a hero's farewell.

Sifa's middle name was (it will make many of us friends of Esther Earl smile, ""Esther""), named after a queen that she very consciously emulated. She came from a beautiful family and survived human rights abuses when she was much younger. She fled to Canada. There, she experienced from a distance, the horrors of the Rwandan genocide where over 80 of her relatives were killed. Our Western media did not report on the genocide. The television only told Sifa of OJ Simpson's White Ford Bronco. It was only through her relatives calls to her, that she learned any thing of what was going on. Some were killed while on the phone with her.

At the start of the genocide in Darfur, Sifa did the only actual sensible thing any one would do (and yet who actually does this?): she dropped everything. She left law school at Boston College, a dream of hers, and committed herself as a leader of the burgeoning anti-genocide movement. When Sifa and I met five years ago, she told me that the tragedy of the world allowing genocide in Darfur was like the memory of her lost loved ones were being spit on. That the world said, ""Never Again"" in the wake of Rwanda's 1994 genocide and still did next to nothing in regards to Darfur, rallied Sifa to move heaven and earth. And any one who has heard Sifa speak, knows what I mean when we say that that her heart could move heaven and earth (I believe, and hope, that it has). Not only with her fierce determination but with her spectacular grace, warmth, humility, curiosity, and humor.

Eventually, she moved with her family back to her home continent where she co-founded the ASYV youth village in Rwanda. She was in the middle of looking for an agent for her memoirs as well as creating a new orphanage in her home of South Africa when she was killed last week in a car accident. Apparently her plans for this orphanage were (like the work of our greatest visionaries) extraordinary, genius, and not replicable. I have been told that it was still too early for any one to step in and complete this project as Sifa envisioned it.

Please let me know if you are interested in our long interviews (some never yet published) and please lend any ideas you may have for how we may work to honor the memory of one of my greatest hero's and a human being who has touched our world with spectacular grace, warmth, humility, curiosity, friendship, humor, and love.

And of course, now and always, the Weapon We Have Is Love,

In the non-Western vision of the world be it Ayurvedic or Chinese medicine, there are generally thought to be seven Chakras. And amazingly enough, each of these chakras has a relationship with each Harry Potter book.

The first Chakra is centered on roots. In the first Harry Potter book, Harry learns his roots as a Wizard.

The second Chakra is centered around the sexual. In the second Harry Potter book, Harry is attacked by a giant phallus in a dark chamber. SHIZAM!

The third Chakra is centered on power. In the third Harry Potter book, Harry is confronted with his own power as a man in the form of Sirius Black (who represents Harry's emerging manhood as Harry learns how to use his wand to create a stag that is actually his dad. #gotfreud - this is all about power.

The fourth Chakra is centered on the heart and links the lower three and higher three chakras together. The fourth Harry Potter book is the heart of the series, linking the first three books into an epic narrative that extends into the last three books.

The fifth Chakra is centered on voice and communication. In the fifth Harry Potter book, Harry has his voice cut off as the Ministry and Daily Prophet call him a liar. He emerges triumphant, his voice intact.

The sixth Chakra is the third eye, centered on intuition. In the sixth Harry Potter book, Dumbledore takes Harry on a journey centered on intuition where he literally tells him that now they are going into the realm of speculation.

The seventh Chakra, the Crown Chakra, is centered on transcendence. The seventh Harry Potter book is essentially about Harry taking on the role of the Christ at King's Cross (with Christ as King, and also let's not forget, wearing a ""crown"") and allowing for the mystical emergence of wandlore, death, and resurrection.","2013-01-25T01:01:54+0000","status",NA,"334095623110_10151248730768111",NA,133,11,26,2013-01-24 20:01:54,"2013-01","2013","Thursday","20:01",20,"8PM to 11PM",400,8000,"20"

He and Gandhi, Mandela, Aung Suu Kyi were perfectly willing to break unjust laws and get arrested for doing so. Harry, Hermione, Ron and every member of the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore's Army broke the law. Katniss Everdeen broek the law. Jean Valjean broke the law. The very concept of the United States of America was founded by men and women who broke the law. 

And let's not forget Galileo, Thich Naht Hanh, Thoreau, Joan of Arc, Socrates, Oscar Wilde, and the slogan ""well behaved women rarely make history."" Once again, we're not encouraging that people should be breaking laws but we are encouraging that we question the notion that the rule of law is what makes someone right.

"2886","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","Here's some crazy thinking about stories and myths and how they help us in a larger transition of our journeys: 

every time you ever think the world can reach a state of perfection, remember that each month, countless people have officially reached the age of puberty. The journey of adult biology emerging through the body of a child is a complex path, made far more complex by an increased desire for social approval beyond their most familial circles. The journey of the adolescent is not one that simply ends either. It continues and it's themes come up again and again in the trajectory of so-called adults. Then of course, there is the biology of human creativity that emerges in these adults, sometimes resulting in the mystical experience of pregnancy and child birth.

Again and again, hidden biological voices emerge from the secret mist of each cell until the biology of the elderly emerge through the body of the adult. 

Eventually, the biology of death will emerge through all of our bodies. And within each transition, there is a hidden journey at play. Not only a hidden journey for each individual but for the deep currents of ""relationship that underly all human experience"" (Joanna Macy) into a broader and infinite net that extends into the infinitude of the Earth, the universe, the multiverse and beyond.

The secret is that all of Infinity is always here and we cannot be separated by the living web of reality. The rub is that our experience as small and finite focal points wrapped in mortal coil involves a near constant journey, and a complex relationship between the small and big selves that make us ""who we are.""

Our myths and stories provide a map to help us navigate these journeys. The characters come as actual guides, companions, and mentors as we walk that journey.

But as for the world: it's not about creating a world that is perfect. In the eyes of eternity, the world is already perfect. But in the wibbly wobbly world of time and separateness, we are not building for a world that has perfected the end of suffering. We are imagining a world that respects the complex, brave, and vulnerable journeys that each individual and community is on in this nonlinear yellow brick road where the Wizard has no answers, there is no end point, the calls for adventure continue, and paradoxically at our feet we are already home. And there's no place like home.","2013-02-05T17:11:03+0000","status",NA,"334095623110_10151287873568111",NA,21,4,2,2013-02-05 12:11:03,"2013-02","2013","Tuesday","12:11",12,"12PM to 3PM",144,1728,"12"

"2872","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","""Harry Potter teaches what many great teachers from a diverse set of traditions have taught: love is the most ancient and powerful form of magic in our world.

""Love does not grab at others with hunger for approval and power, be that power in the form of dominance or subordination. Love does not wish to bring any one down with it. Love is not that part of us that enjoys reading about the woes of celebrities in the hopes that there are 'pretty' people more miserable than we. Love is not narcissism. Love is not narrow. What love is, is expansive. 

""Love is trusting. Love allows. It does not control – it allows. It accepts. It cares. It blesses.

""Like Harry, we can appreciate the pleasures of our world through Quidditch and Bertie Bott's every flavor beans. Like Harry, we can appreciate the loving friendship that is central to a romantic connection. And like Harry, we can truly do what the Dark Lord had no comprehension of: we can love in spite of and because of loss. It is that capacity that gives us a power that the Dark Lord knows not.

""The power of expressing that love is at the heart of our world's deepest fantasy. And since fantasy is not an escape from reality but an invitation to go deeper into it, love is at the heart of all reality. Happy Valentine's Day."" -Andrew Slack","2013-02-14T18:32:27+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/thehpalliance/photos/a.10150112250908111.280078.334095623110/10151303676323111/?type=3","334095623110_10151303676323111","The Harry Potter Alliance with Carmela Radcliffe and Carmela Pasaoa.",135,2,43,2013-02-14 13:32:27,"2013-02","2013","Thursday","13:32",13,"12PM to 3PM",169,2197,"13"

I'm supposed to compare Nobel Peace Prize Laureates with Dumbledore, which I'm happy to do. However, I'm concerned: how familiar are elementary school students with Dumbledore?

I'm assuming the answer is ""very familiar"" but as most of you know, the age group I'm more used to working with is teenagers. I'm also not sure if there are more relevant stories to the average 5th grader. I could compare Nobel Peace Prize winners also to Jedi, but I'm not keeping track of the latest stuff going on in the Star Wars universe for kids. Any input there, would be helpful. I think Gandalf is a great analogy but I'm not sure if that's going to be any more resonant than Dumbledore.

"2770","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","From our executive director Andrew Slack, ""A Letter to My Fellow Heterosexuals"":

""To my fellow members of the heterosexual community:

""White bigots have maintained they were right to keep blacks enslaved, killed, tortured, barred from voting, from restaurants, from certain sidewalks, and lunch counters, and bathrooms and bridges and yes, from marrying whites. But they lost. Just a few years ago, a bigoted white man refused to marry a couple in Louisiana because they are interracial. The spark of outrage has been so huge that the conservative governor of this Southern state has asked for this man’s resignation.

""Some Harry Potter fans have not liked what the HPA has to say about marriage equality. But I believe that those in the LGBTQ community will be granted that right. One day conservative governors from Southern states will look at those against marriage equality with the same disdain that the Louisiana conservative governor looked at those who opposed interracial marriage in 2009.

""And while there are many Harry Potter fans against equal marriage who have asked us to look at “both sides” of the argument, as if an argument had only two sides and that was it, I’d prefer it if you and I together could look at our privilege for being heterosexual in this society.

""We’ve never had to deal with the isolation of keeping a secret of our sexuality or gender identity. We’ve never had to reach for the courage to come out of the closet and face whatever isolation comes from that to say, 'Mom and dad, I’m heterosexual or exactly the gender that you thought I was.'

""We’ve never had to again, and again, and again, when we meet people for the first time, wonder if they won’t like us if and when they find out that we’re heterosexual. We’ve never had to hear about heterosexuals murdered for being heterosexuals and to fear for our lives on account of our sexuality. We’ve never had to fear for our jobs based on our sexuality. We’ve never heard about heartbreaking tales of countless men who mainstream society allowed to die of AIDS without trying to do anything to help – because they were heterosexual.

""We’ve never had to be told that we have no right to marry a person that we love. That if they are dying in the hospital that we cannot visit them and that our children that we’ve been raising together could be removed from us and given to someone else. We’ve never been told that we are not allowed to adopt on the grounds that we are heterosexual.

""Such privilege could make us pause. Could make us realize that when we talk down to people who are in the LGBTQ community, when we deny them their rights, we are denying people who have done nothing but acted on courage that we have had the privilege to not have to reach for in regards to our sexuality. We are discriminating against people who by their very existence to the injustices bestowed upon them have shown true courage, bravery, and yes, MORAL fiber.

""We are discriminating against our doctors, our soldiers, our artists, our police, our teachers, our ministers, our rabbis, our neighbors, our sisters, our brothers, our parents, and anyone we know who is LGBGTQ, including potentially our own children and grandchildren. Let us not skewer those who are LGBTQ any longer against a cross of social crucifixion. Let us instead look at each other as equals and learn from each other and take the lessons that we have learned from Harry Potter about the power of love, to heart.

""Harry Potter’s eleven years living in a cupboard for his identity as a Wizard reminds us that no one should have to live inside of a closet for their identity. Dumbledore, and we as readers, understand with great sympathy those like Hagrid a half-giant and Lupin a werewolf, struggling to live in the closet because of their identity. Dumbledore allows for them to come to Hogwarts despite the objections of those who know of their identities – in the HPA we have spent years working to create an environment where those still living in and out of the closet because of their sexual orientation will not be legally subjected to existential intolerance and irrational prejudice.

""In Half-Blood Prince page 624, when in the middle of discussing the prospect of a marriage that would challenge the status quo’s ""perfectly normal thank you very much"" definition of “marriage” McGonagall says, “Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world.”
 
""I think we all know deep down that one of the reasons Harry Potter is so popular is because it artfully conveys a message that is so very needed at this time - that the forces of fear, intolerance, and hatred come and go but they are no match for the power of love. In the Harry Potter Alliance we are proud to be standing on the side of inclusion, Civil Rights, and love. Standing for equal marriage is therefore an obvious fit for us. We believe in building a society that demonstrates to this nation and to this world that human connection can be based on the expansive principles of love rather than the contracting delusions of fear. We believe in working hand in hand, for a world based on human rights as well as the right to be human.
 
""Let this be a truth that is echoed in the United States Congress, the Supreme Court, the Oval Office, and the desk of every journalist, politician, and preacher. Let it be a truth that echoes far beyond US borders, into every corner of our world.
 
""In the words of the greatest Wizard in the world, 'Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.' Let our hearts remain open and our aims be for a world where we all have that very basic right to be human.
 
""And in the words of Harry and the Potters and the Harry Potter Alliance, 'The Weapon We Have Is Love.'

With Hope and Love,

Andrew""","2013-03-28T02:31:59+0000","status",NA,"334095623110_10151372793948111",NA,324,30,186,2013-03-27 22:31:59,"2013-03","2013","Wednesday","22:31",22,"8PM to 11PM",484,10648,"22"

""I recently picked up my phone and texted one of my very dear friends Courtney E. Martin.

Me: I'm in a dentists office crying right now. OMG. I'm reading this amazing article about Daniel Radcliffe and what a versatile artist he is and the article ends with him talking about a TED talk he just watched that really inspired him. Dude. It's your talk!!! This may not be as big a deal for you as it is for me but wow. Just...Courtney. Wow.

Courtney: I don't even know who that is?! Will you send me the article?

Me: Harry freaking Potter.

Courtney: What?! That's crazy. Are you sure it was my talk he's talking about?

I was sure. I was sure because I've watched Courtney's talk over 20 times as every time I watch it, I feel renewed and inspired and filled with pride that not only is there a person in the world like her but that such a person is my friend. I'll be writing some more on Courtney in a bit but here is her talk that inspired our Daniel: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXKNA_vfHWs

Here's the ""money quote"" of Daniel discussing Courtney's talk:

""Radcliffe is prepared for that. He watched a TED talk recently, on reinventing feminism. 'The speaker said that part of growing up is aiming to succeed but being fulfilled by failing really well,' he says. 'That’s what I feel this year has been all about for me. I’m looking at my work for the first time and not cringing. I’m going, ‘Yes, this is closer to what I want it to be.’""

I will be writing more about Courtney Martin in a little bit and her amazing work. Please stay tuned.

"2649","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","From our Executive Director Andrew Slack with a very exciting and gamechanging announcement:

""Some MAJOR personal news: I'm moving to New York City this June as one of three Nathan Cummings Foundation Fellows. There's too many people to thank right now from David Fisher for telling me about it to Ashley Clement, Lauren Bird, Acacia Bowman, Paul DeGeorge for helping me through this process that I am going to simply forget a lot of people.

Here's the story: Nathan Cummings Foundation (NCF) is AMAZING, works on the issues that are closest to my heart, and just started a fellowship for three people to each be awarded $100,000, move to NYC, and spend an entire year within the vibrant community at NCF to be as innovative in social justice as one can be. After a long application process, I was just selected to be one of these fellows.

This is a very emotional thing for me. I will now have the independence, support, and resources to focus on so many of the ideas that I've been working on with all the Board members at the HPA not to mention close friends and mentors since 2000 (or earlier).

As an NCF Fellow, I will be extending the work of the HPA, focusing on CAMPAIGNS, CLASSROOMS, and COMMUNITY. More on this soon but here's a summary:

CAMPAIGNS include connecting the upcoming Superman film to immigration reform, the upcoming Hunger Games film to anti-poverty, and organizing baseball fans to become involved in community service. 

CLASSROOMS involve working with curriculum experts where we will teach teachers on a totally original ""Imagine Better curriculum"" that uses popular culture to get students more socially, emotionally, and yes: civically engaged - to become the heroes they've been dreaming of being. 

COMMUNITY includes building a tight knit network of fan activists (the Harry Potter Alliance, the Boxscene Project, Nerdfighters, etc) on making fan activism a coherent force to be reckoned with.

A crazy world warrants crazy solutions. We in the HPA/Imagine Better community are going to give the world precisely that, and I am so grateful for the validation and investment by an established foundation where I can spend my full professional time moving from the story of Harry Potter to all stories through the Imagine Better Network. 

What this specifically means for the HPA and Imagine Better as entities that are separate, similar, are the same will be determined through a very long process that our incredible board and senior staff are currently undergoing with the amazing company Refine and Focus (special thanks to Zach Braiker and Purnima Thakre who are some of the greatest mentors I have ever had).

I am still in shock that this has even happened, nervous/sad about moving from my home of Somerville to NYC, and so so excited at the same time. Thank you to so many people (too difficult to even list) that have made all of this possible. In the words of President Barack Hussein Obama, ""you didn't build that."" I didn't. Every step, every inch of our fledgling fan activist movement (and my NCF application) has been through the work of a community of friends, colleagues, mentors, partners, donors, media, and more. 

We do not dream alone. We dream together. Thank you for including me in your dreams and thank you for allowing my dreams to be part of yours. And together we will allow the beautiful dreams of humanity to help us transcend the nightmarish social injustices that besiege our planet.

For more: http://www.ncf.org/news/Meet_the_Fellows

I feel so humbled, so excited, and so grateful to every single person and so freaking excited to soon be in the nerve center of humanity at an incredible place working with fellow innovators as we shake things up.

Why invest in women?

*Women reinvest 80% of their income in the health and well-being of their children.
*A child born to a mother who can read is 50% more like to live past age 5.
*For girls, every additional year of school increases her future earning potential by 20%.
*Daughters of economically empowered mothers are more likely to follow in their footsteps.

""I’m Julian Gomez, 20 years old. My parents brought my sisters and I to the United States from Argentina when I was just under 2 years old, so I’ve grown up here, made all my friends here, gone to school here, and just about lived my whole life here. In January 2013, I received Deferred Action (DACA). Before then, I was considered undocumented; I couldn’t get a license, much less a social security number, as far as the U.S. government was concerned, I didn’t exist. Even now that I’m “DACAmented,” I’m in some weird temporary limbo where I have employment authorization for 2 years, but I’m still not considered an American by law. I recently graduated with an Associate degree from the Honors College at Miami Dade College with a 3.89 GPA, where I was paying out-of-state tuition even though I took the bus to school every day from the house my parents bought 11 years ago. I’ve been accepted to four universities to finish my Bachelor’s in Film, but all of them consider me an international student and can only offer me limited scholarship. So now I’m applying for a $45,000 private loan so I can transfer to, ironically, American University in Wahington, D.C., because I’m not eligible for any federal loans or grants, despite my financial need and academic success. If nothing changes from now to when I graduate in 2 years, I’ll be a recent graduate with at least $90,000 in student loan debt. This is because the country I’ve called home for the last 18 years doesn’t consider me a part of it. Despite this, I’m a privileged DREAMer, because of the over 65,000 undocumented students that graduate from American high schools every year, only 5% can afford to go to college. I urge you to support immigration reform, it is the American way.""","2013-06-12T23:28:22+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/thehpalliance/photos/a.10150112250908111.280078.334095623110/10151486437753111/?type=3","334095623110_10151486437753111",NA,179,9,30,2013-06-12 19:28:22,"2013-06","2013","Wednesday","19:28",19,"4PM to 7PM",361,6859,"19"

""Part of the HPA's Equality FTW is around education equality. And a big part of what we're focusing on is equality in our pedagogy: where students can self-direct their own learning and civic engagement through their love for stories.

""As such, I have been working with the Smithsonian EdLab to roll out a new program for after schools across the US. Me and the EdLab folks are right now working on an intense pilot program with a small group of young people aged 11 to 15. 

""Today was amazing! We watched part of Batman Begins, explored the hero's journey, created our own super hero stories (I am astounded by the creativity of these kids with their stories!) and decided on what kind of campaign we'd be working on together to improve DC.

""The Director of the program took the kids out to Union Station to take notes on what they noticed. The number one thing that the kids noticed was this: Union Station is not a place that is welcoming for either kids or the elderly. The EdLab Director asked them, ""well who is it welcoming for?"" One of the kids pointed to the adults in the room: 'You guys! It's all made for business people. Not us.'

""And so we voted on what our campaign is. We have created the Bureau of Re-Funification. The mission is to begin work on making DC a more fun place for kids, teens, and the elderly. Tomorrow we'll be going through DC to think of ideas. But the kids really want to hear your ideas too.

""So: how can our cities be more fun? More welcoming? How can we design cities where kids and the elderly feel like they are welcomed and where things aren't always so serious?""","2013-07-09T01:36:15+0000","status",NA,"334095623110_10151533747348111",NA,26,7,2,2013-07-08 21:36:15,"2013-07","2013","Monday","21:36",21,"8PM to 11PM",441,9261,"21"

"2417","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","From the HPA's Executive Director Andrew Slack:

The story surrounding the acquittal of Trayvon Martin's killer, George Zimmerman is causing a great deal of anger: some are angry that George Zimmerman was not sentenced to prison on manslaughter, some are angry at those people, some of ""those people"" are angry at ""those people.""

None of this anger, none of the name calling, and none of the very important and necessary discussions surrounding this case brings back to life a young man of 17 who was simply going to buy some Skittles and walk back to his dad. Whatever your opinions are on this case, that young man is dead. And there is absolutely no reason that he should be.

The case of Trayvon Martin's murder has raised a ton of issues that resonate with the story of Harry Potter including the charge of racism. Racism is an issue that effects the entire world and most certainly effects the United States of America. If we are to be brave, truly brave, we are going to need to talk about racism. Really truly talk about racism, about violence, about bullying and guns and violence and the complexities of the law.

My hope is for the Harry Potter Alliance to engage in such a discussion throughout our continual Equality FTW movement. But in this very raw moment when emotions are flying high, when people are in mourning and others are feeling defensive, I want us to go back to the most basic place:

The Weapon We Have Is Love. 

Right now, we in the HPA are sending love and our deepest condolences to the family, friends, and loved ones of Trayvon Martin. 

We are sending our love and deepest condolences to the family, friends, and loved ones of all young people who have had their lives taken from them by gun violence. 

We are sending our love for all people of color who are parents and fear that their children are not safe. And we are sending our love and compassion to all young people who fear that they are not safe.

Like I said, my hope is that we will get to a point where we have a more in depth discussion that explores the complexities of race and violence. But we are going to start from a place of love and inclusion. A place where all are welcomed. And a place of great sadness that the world has lost a 17 year old young man who was good and kind and funny and had so much potential for his future.","2013-07-15T02:11:51+0000","status",NA,"334095623110_10151543977863111",NA,257,19,48,2013-07-14 22:11:51,"2013-07","2013","Sunday","22:11",22,"8PM to 11PM",484,10648,"22"

"2410","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","Our Executive Director Andrew Slack discusses some of his thoughts and feelings on the tragic loss of Cory Monteith:

""So. Cory died from a disease he actively had for the last two decades: the mental illness that is drug addiction. I had a strong feeling that this was the cause of death given his long term struggle with this. The disease of drug addiction happens to be one that has directly effected people in my life who I love the most - and therefore it has effected me. Our culture still views the disease as a moral illness when in fact it is a mental one. 

Our culture has a very immature attitude in dealing with complex problems and drug addiction is a very, very complex problem. 

Like most mental illness, it is hard for the culture at large to accept it as outside of the person's control the way we accept Type 1 diabetes as outside of a child's control. And it is true, that unlike Type 1 diabetes, addicts have some degree of agency. There is hope that they can get out of the disease based on decisions that they ultimately make. Cory made decisions over the course of two decades that showed he was a fighter. Even in March, he voluntarily checked in to rehab. This did not guarantee that he would survive the disease.

And the small window of reality that there was a chance that that person could have survived if only they had done something different. Or the notion that drugs are done by ""the bad people."" I want to say this: it is understandable that our culture feels this way. Human blame is an instant reaction to the human condition of suffering. But our culture's attitude that drug addiction is somehow a moral failing of an individual is more dangerous than drug addiction itself. Drug addiction is a disease that needs serious treatment. But so does our culture's response to drug addiction, to mental illness in general, and to all disease.

It hits on an even larger issue: the sociology of birth and death. We live in a culture where death is so feared that we would rather keep people miserable, hooked up on to machines in order to preserve the ""sanctity of life"" rather than the ""dignity of life."" The technocratic Muggle Minded culture views death as a defeat. And therefore, any one who dies as having lost. Voldemort felt this way about his mother. Most of us feel this way toward death, on some level and it's encouraged by our culture at large.

This issue gets magnified when someone is actively injecting poison into their body that will make them die or at the very least cower away from the reality of their feelings.

So let me say this. I only knew Cory through his acting on Glee. I didn't know him the way other Gleeks know him and I certainly don't know him the way his friends and family know him. But I still can say this: he was not a loser. He was a winner. And he survived under the condition of a disease that one does not receive accolades or awards for surviving. It is very difficult for any one to understand what an addict goes through - including the addict. 

This also hits on other issues around how we allow for grief and mourning and making space for it even when the way we knew that person was through the boundary of a screen. But my hope is that we can have a larger discussion around addiction as well. 

And I sincerely hope that if any ignorant and sociologically sick individuals are putting any thing up on the Internet that Cory is to blame for his own death, etc - that the Glee community can stand by and celebrate his strength. In the words of Jonathan Larson, ""To people living with, living with, living with...not dying from disease."" And even when we die from disease - and all of us will die, to not view that as somehow ""not alive"" - but to change our paradigm as to how this works.

This is immensely complicated and difficult. But we must remove blame from those who suffer from mental illness while at the same time allowing them space to find their own agency in the midst of their recovery.

Cory died. His spirit lives. Through the power of music and the power of performance and story - we can tell a different story about addiction and disease than the dominant story we hear in our culture's muggle minded paradigm. One that celebrates rather than condemns. That loves rather than fears. That empathizes rather than pities.

I'm going to say that last one again: ""That empathizes rather than pities."" Please think on that. So many of us would rather pity than empathize. Fix pain rather than be with it. 

So much more to say. Including the fact that our entire culture has the mindset of that as an addict and all of us need spiritual recovery from the depletion that we have suffered from. 

I cried when when my suspicions were confirmed that Cory died from this disease and it hit a very personal chord. This is very, very, very sad. Beyond any thing I can really say in an attempt at eloquent words. The loss is real, palpable, and truly tragic beyond measure.""","2013-07-18T16:04:02+0000","link","http://cdn03.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/overstreet-premiere/chord-overstreet-cory-monteith-glee-guys-at-the-premiere-02.jpg","334095623110_10151550079503111",NA,200,20,36,2013-07-18 12:04:02,"2013-07","2013","Thursday","12:04",12,"12PM to 3PM",144,1728,"12"

""I'm on a plane to San Francisco, representing Superman Is An Immigrant at a screening of 'Documented,' hosted by Mark Zuckerberg. 'Documented' is the story of Jose Antonio Vargas, the first Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist to come out as an undocumented American.

Jose is an amazing friend and collaborator and even personally coached and mentored the HPA's Julian G. Gomez in coming out as undocumented in a way that was nothing short of remarkable. To make this a moment of great pride for me, the film 'Documented' that will be airing tonight was in part made by the HPA's Lauren Bird who up until the film's completion, had been working for Jose since meeting him at LeakyCon 2012.

Needless to say, I'm very excited. This is a tremendous moment in American history and world history to help frame what it means to be an immigrant. It's time for all Americans with papers to press 'Like' on ending deportations and implementing comprehensive immigration reform.""","2013-08-05T16:32:46+0000","status",NA,"334095623110_10151585563463111",NA,49,0,4,2013-08-05 12:32:46,"2013-08","2013","Monday","12:32",12,"12PM to 3PM",144,1728,"12"

We send love to all those who have lost loved ones in the madness that followed the attacks in 2001. We send love also to those in Darfur, in the Congo, and beyond: to those whose suffering has been ignored in part due to this madness. We send hope that those who have been living in fear for over a decade can find safety and healing. We send hope to the children of Syria and hope that all Syrian civilians find peace.

And we work. We work with a deep commitment to become a better society… a world that understands how to hold space for grieving and how to listen to those who have not been listened to.""

It wasn’t our first show of support for the cause and it won’t be our last, but we need your help to keep fighting! Our goal for our second annual Equality FTW fundraiser is $100,000 and - get this - we’re already over halfway there!

Our awesome partners - including Team Starkid - have been an amazing help in providing some (totally) awesome perks, but the donations come from everybody.

"2224","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","""When it comes down to it, is there a hard line between want and need? You might think that need is just the basics. Food, water, warmth, air, but you haven’t had most of a century to think about it. When you need a bath, do you really need a bath? No, you might say, you want a bath. A lack of a bath isn’t going to kill you. Your ever-increasing stink and the bits of grit behind your ear aren’t going to come to life and strangle you in the night. So, you would argue, you want a bath, you don’t need it. 

I disagree. You need a bath because polite society (these days at least) expects it of you. There’s a need here, not to be clean, but to be a part. Because witches and wizards are humans, and humans need to be part of a larger whole. If you disagree with me, that is your right, but I may be the world’s foremost expert on need, so it is extremely likely that you are wrong. 

At Hogwarts, the basic needs haven’t changed too much in the last eighty years. The need for the loo has always been and remains the most common. The need for a hiding spot, for a clinic, a classroom, for the occasional soft corner for a couple that might not feel safe together elsewhere. Of the needs I have served, that is my favorite by far. Though helping a certain group of young witches and wizards find something that had long burned a hole in my consciousness was a wonderful moment, slaking the needs of love is the most rewarding."" - an except from Hank Green's ""The Womb of Requirement""

""Today, on our eighth birthday, I feel so incredibly proud of everything we’ve achieved. Our Equality FTW fundraiser is $16,000 over our goal, and we still have two more days to campaign. Our mission has been endorsed and embraced by thousands of fans, educational foundations, movie studios, and partners like Evanna Lynch, Patrick Rothfuss, John and Hank Green, and Jo Rowling herself.

""Together we have sent five cargo planes full of medical supplies to Haiti (each named after a different Harry Potter character), donated over 70,000 books across the world, started substantially transforming education, began a constructive dialogue with the CEO of Warner Brothers to make all Harry Potter chocolate Fair Trade, and made significant strides for the LGBTQ, anti-genocide, and media reform movements.

""Right now, though, I want to tell you a story. It’s a long story - as those close to me know, I love long stories - but it’s worth it. This is the story of the HPA. I’m working on compiling this story into a book, but for now, here’s an excerpt.""","2013-10-10T22:57:20+0000","link","http://thehpalliance.tumblr.com/post/63680353589/andrew-slacks-hpa-origin-story","334095623110_10151715123368111",NA,25,0,1,2013-10-10 18:57:20,"2013-10","2013","Thursday","18:57",18,"4PM to 7PM",324,5832,"18"

"2169","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","A Message on National Coming Out Day from our Executive Director Andrew Slack:

""I’ve never had to come out to my parents to tell them, “Mom and dad, I’m heterosexual.” 

Or: 'Mom and dad, I’m a man.'

Everyone assumes that I must be heterosexual because I’m a man. And everyone assumes that I’m a man because my sex is male.

Secretly, I’ve had doubts. Boys used to call me 'gay' because I loved musicals and 'a girl' because I wasn’t good at sports (for some mutated reason it was assumed that sports are just for boys).

But any way, sometimes I’d question myself, 'what if these bullies really are right? what if  I really am gay?' or 'what if I really am a girl? '

It wasn’t a pleasant experience to be told I’m something that I’m not, but I’m grateful that I had it. Because it opened my eyes early on to how easy I had it compared to my friends who actually are not heterosexual. Later on, it helped open my eyes to how easy I had it compared to my friends who are trans.

And it’s helped me realize that all these gender norms and sexuality norms are mainly rules that our Muggle Minded culture tells us we need to follow. That way we can be like the Dursleys and be perfectly normal thank you very much.

Well, I’m not perfectly normal. I’ve never been perfectly normal. And I don’t want to be perfectly normal. Forget Muggle Games. I want Magic. I want to love and be loved fully as I am.

Everyone has that right. And today on National Coming Out Day, I hope that we can all lend our support and thoughts to those who struggle with coming out as lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning, asexual, or in the case of gender identification, as trans. Or those who would rather just go with the term, 'queer' as a catch all phrase that takes back the persecution that 'non-straight' people have had to endure for so long.

I hope we can send our appreciation to those who have already come out but feel like, with every new job and every new friend they may have to come out again.

I hope we can just sit here in our full humanity and remember that we are beautiful, amazing, and miraculous just the way we are. And that whatever our sexual or our gender identification is, that it too is beautiful as it is.

There is no normal. Just the magic of love and the courage to act on it.

Happy National Coming Out Day.""","2013-10-12T01:33:58+0000","status",NA,"334095623110_10151717201563111",NA,380,18,78,2013-10-11 21:33:58,"2013-10","2013","Friday","21:33",21,"8PM to 11PM",441,9261,"21"

And I started thinking....when the HPA turns 11, we need to find a way to get it invited to Hogwarts. When it turns 13, we need to give it a giant Bar Mitzvah (so long as it studies hard on it's ve'havta and Torah portion) with a cool DJ and 17 year old dancers dressed in tacky clothes. 

When it's 16, we'll get it a permit and then a license. Of course at that point, I'm probably going to have to have ""the talk"" with the organization about being respectful, responsible, and safe. And I'm NOT LOOKING FORWARD to worrying about where it is all night!

But really, I'm hoping that our teenaged HPA is really into learning and Nerdfighting and watching John and Hank Green and being an HPA member. Because those teenagers are the best. Wait.

Check out her full madlib below and thanks to everyone who supported #EqualityFTW by entering the contest!

""Flobberworm (also known as the King of Can of Sodas)
M.O.M. Classification: XXXXX

The first recorded flobberworm was bred by Harry Freakin’ Potter, a jittery wizard and dentist, who discovered after much experimentation that a fizzing whizbee placed beneath a honey badger would produce a gigantic can of soda possessed of extraordinarily superfluous powers.
The flobberworm is a brilliant lime green can of soda that may reach up to fifty feet in length. The male has a bicycle helmet upon its head. It has gravely fervent fangs, but its most dangerous means of attack is the gaze of its large gold eyes. Anyone looking directly into these will suffer instant death.

If the food source is sufficient (the flobberworm will eat all mammals and birds and most corndogs), the can of soda may attain a very great age. Harry Freakin’ Potter’s flobberworm is believed to have lived for close on 64 months.

The creation of flobberworms has been illegal since medieval times, although the practice is easily concealed by simply removing the fizzing whizbee from beneath the honey badger when the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures comes to call. However, since cans of soda are uncontrollable except by dentists, they are as dangerous to most jittery wizards as to anybody else, and there have been no recorded sightings of flobberworms in Western Canada for at least four hundred years.""","2013-11-02T22:34:52+0000","status",NA,"334095623110_10151762368103111",NA,84,5,3,2013-11-02 18:34:52,"2013-11","2013","Saturday","18:34",18,"4PM to 7PM",324,5832,"18"

"2078","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","Andrew Slack: I should clarify what I meant when I said that I want President Obama doing a 3 finger salute. If you are not aware, the HPA is running a Hunger Games-themed campaign called Odds In Our Favor. In the Hunger Games, the 3 finger salute is the symbol that we are in this together, to fight economic inequality.

We live in a country where 1% own 40% of the economy. Where 80% are forced to fight over scraps: just 7% of the economy. And yet President Snow's 1% continue to push for more cuts in life saving programs such as food stamps and unemployment benefits...much of these are needed because the 1% screwed up our economy with their recklessness. And after we bailed them out, they have moved to pushing us out of our homes.

1 in 5 children live in poverty, 1 in 6 Americans go hungry. The Districts are in poverty while the Capitol is partying.

But then there's us: fan activists who have proven that fantasy is not an escape from our world but an invitation to go deeper into it. We are going to go deeper into it and we are going to fight for 99% of this country in our Districts to be granted equality.

This is not a small moment. This is THE moment when we have a coalescence of an amazing campaign with an original message AND the entire world talking about the topic of that campaign. President Trumka of the ALF-CIO, the biggest coalition of unions in the world, has our back. 

I want every progressive organization in the country to use the three finger salute as THEIR symbol.

The 3 finger salute is admitting that we have a problem and that we are going to work on that problem together. The problem is economic inequality. 

It's the biggest problem in the United States. It is the only problem that's gotten worse every year since 1974. every other social issue has gotten better. NOT THIS ONE. This one is worse.

Dr. King was not assassinated until he changed his focus from race to class. Malcolm X was not assassinated until he changed his focus from race to class? And why did they change their focus? Because they realized that there would be no progress on race until we tackle class.

We must admit that we have a problem and that we are in this together. That is what we are doing. That is our three finger salute.

After we join together to blow this up, we are going to get every progressive leader who is for economic equality to do a three finger salute. Which means we need you to do this with us. 

This is it. We've been working for this moment when the HPA started on October 10, 2005. We're here. We've arrived with an amazing community that supports and loves each other, believes in the power of love, and is Internet savvy.

We have the power to change history. 

And we will not stop until the President of the United States joins us in it.

So can you join me in doing a 3 finger salute? Thank you so very much for being a community that has sent 5 cargo planes to Haiti, built libraries across the world, funded the protection of thousands of civilians in Darfur and Burma - helped pass marriage equality in Maine and Rhode Island - helped pass the Maryland Dream Act. Through Superman Is An Immigrant: helped work on immigration reform.

All equality issues. And now: the we join together in community with the 3 finger salute. Until the odds are in everyone's favor!!!!! Can you do it?

"2033","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","Let one of our volunteers, Claudia Morales, tell you why the you should consider supporting us in Project For Awesome: 

""Last year’s Project for Awesome helped fund what the HPA was able to accomplish in 2013. This included another successful Accio Books! drive, the continued fight for marriage equality, the Apparating Library, a kickass presence at two LeakyCons, a Superman-inspired stand for immigration reform, awesome new merch, and the ongoing Hunger Games campaign.

Even in the short time I’ve been with the HPA, I’ve seen it grow tremendously as a direct result of a ceaselessly generous, driven community. From HPA FTW to Equality FTW and everything in between, the organization is made possible by the people who support it.

One of my favorite things about this is that it’s not just donation-based. This is the first year I’ve been able to donate anything to any fundraising effort we’ve had, but I regard my participation from previous years as equally important. Votes, comments, and word of mouth are all vital; they’re also extremely accessible.

As 2014 approaches, I’ve been getting more and more excited to see what the new year has in store for the HPA. But there’s an order to things - in order for a “next year” to happen, we have to close out this year with one last big push, right? So here goes.

John and Hank have said it several times today, and they’ve said it before - the Project for Awesome is extraordinary not just in the good that drives it, but in the choice it gives the community. Every year, Nerdfighteria is given the opportunity to choose the charities that will receive a portion of the donations.

This makes the HPA’s opportunity to be one of the chosen recipients even more special, and I urge everybody to consider voting and spreading the word. No matter how much Harry Potter merch I buy and no matter how many times I visit the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando, nothing makes magic feel as real as this organization does. Nothing else is truer to the heart, message and vision of the story.

I’ve never come across anything as empowering, sincere, or moving as what we’ve accomplished in this community. I want nothing more than for it to continue. This is our chance to make that possible.

You can find all the videos made on the HPA’s behalf here. We’ve also compiled a post with the direct links to the voting page for each video here. It’s really just a matter of clicking the vote buttons and spreading the word. I’m not exaggerating when I say it would mean the world.

After all, it’s real for us.

Since the start of the year, we've raised our total number of book donations to communities in need to 120,000. 

--We now have 200 Chapters on five continents improving their local communities in the name of Harry Potter. 

--We were featured in the PBS documentary, ""Is School Enough?"" hailing us as a cutting edge model for engaging young people in learning outside the classroom.

--We have broadly expanded our campaign on corporate transparency regarding child slavery and collected over 200,000 signatures to send to Warner Bros. concerning their questionably-sourced chocolate frogs.

--With our Superman is An Immigrant campaign we collaborated with immigration reform leaders to begin changing the conversation on immigration.

--Everyone from Hank Green to major progressive organizers (like the AFL-CIO) are helping us take back the narrative of the Hunger Games story. With an op-ed in the LA Times and a campaign video with nearly a half-million views, we’ll keep going until the odds are in everyone’s favor.

--And just one of the many things to look forward to in 2014 is the Pearson Foundation working with us to put both Superman Is An Immigrant and Odds In Our Favor into public school curriculums.

These are no small feats and they all happen because of members like you. 

We're hoping that you can help make 2014 our best year ever at the HPA. If you believe in the power of stories to change the world, please invest in us with a small donation by midnight tonight: http://thehpalliance.org/donate","2013-12-31T20:42:05+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/thehpalliance/photos/a.10150112250908111.280078.334095623110/10151889080383111/?type=3","334095623110_10151889080383111",NA,45,1,2,2013-12-31 15:42:05,"2013-12","2013","Tuesday","15:42",15,"12PM to 3PM",225,3375,"15"

""Harry Potter teaches us what many great teachers have taught: love is the most ancient and powerful form of magic in our world. And like Harry, we have the capacity to love and this gives us a power that the Dark Lord knows not.

Love does not grab at others with hunger for approval and power. Love does not wish to bring any one down with it. Love is not narcissism. Love is not narrow. Love is expansive. Love does not control - it allows. It accepts. It cares. It blesses.

So love your friends, love your family, love Ginny and/or Hermione. 

Happy Valentine’s Day."" - Andrew Slack","2014-02-14T21:33:46+0000","status",NA,"334095623110_10151976100823111",NA,238,6,50,2014-02-14 16:33:46,"2014-02","2014","Friday","16:33",16,"4PM to 7PM",256,4096,"16"

Watch this speech because Ellen Page is refreshingly self-aware, grateful, and eloquent about her relationship to the movement as an actress.

Watch this speech because a person who has struggled and prevailed so much is bravely letting you in.

"1890","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","From our Executive Director Andrew Slack, on the 20th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide: 

""Today marks the 20th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide. When approximately 1 million innocent men, women, and children were killed in 100 days. An international community that was celebrating Schindler's List with a message of ""Never Again"" revealed itself to be more interested in film and less interested in life. The lessons of the Holocaust fell on deaf ears and the memory of the murdered were spat on as those with power and influence turned the other way in the face of well funded killing operations that are an evil beyond evil. Please take action below and show the people of Rwanda that we will not forget or abandon them in the future. 

And let us pause and remember the unbelievable reserves of courage, vision, mourning, and processes regarding peace, coexistence, and in some cases, forgiveness that Rwandans have employed these last 20 years.

And let us try and forgive ourselves for collectively allowing - actually, encouraging this genocide to have taken place (because when it did, Americans and our allies pulled out all forces and France made a fortune selling weapons to be used for the killings). This is not simply a day to remember when some Rwandans failed their friends and neighbors. This is a day when the entire international community failed to show the basic compassion necessary to live in a world that has even one iota of respect for justice, compassion itself, and love.

If we are to worship that mysterious force of love, we must remember and be held collectively accountable for the approximately one million who were killed and millions more who were intimately effected by one of the most heinous 100 days in human history. Rwandans are our brothers and sisters and we treated them in a way that is beneath the most elemental levels human decency. This is a day to remember. A day of tremendous sadness beyond sadness. A day that requires our collective society to listen to the voices from 20 years ago, calling for help. A day that requires us to listen to the survivors who lived through that period or were born from the wreckage of that time. And it is a day to remember our international obligation to understand that there is no us and them. Only us. Only us. Only us.

We must ""love each other or perish."" And in the name of all that is sacred and holy, let us choose love. For those in Rwanda and those Congolese who continue to suffer because of the genocide that occurred in Rwanda 20 years ago. Those Rwandan women who contracted HIV due to being gang raped during the genocide as adults, teens, or as young girls. For those in Darfur that our president and the president before him continue to ignore, spitting on the memory of those who were killed during the genocide 20 years ago. Those in the Nuba mountains suffering a similar fate to Darfuris from the same leader (Sudan's president Omar al-Bashir). Those all over our world from East Burma to Northern Uganda and on and on and on.

And for today and the next 100 days: we remember Rwanda's murdered and those who love them.

If humanity is to thrive or survive at all, we must take this moment and remember. Remember. Remember. We must mourn. And we must act. We must sing. And we must heal. We must cry. And we must smile. We must embrace each other. In short, must love each or perish. And let us remember Rwanda.""

"1872","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","In celebration of #AccioBooks, HPA members all over the world are unleashing their inner Hermione Granger and spreading the joy of reading. Since 2009, HPA members have helped build libraries in Rwanda, New York City, the Mississippi Delta, and Portland, OR. This year, we are bringing the magic to Detroit!

We are partnering with the Brightmoor Community Center and our University of Michigan chapter, the Whomping Wolverines, because low literacy is a major issue in Detroit. A little wand waving and a quick Google search leads curious witches and wizards to a mind-boggling statistic: 47% of Detroit residents qualify as “functionally illiterate” and struggle with reading, writing, speaking, and computational skills. Some have questioned whether the 47% statistic is accurate or timely (the original study was conducted in 1993), but most sources agree: low literacy levels are a major issue in Detroit. 

Being able to read and understand complex texts is what allowed Hermione to identify the monster hidden in the Chamber of Secrets and to uncover the truth behind Beedle the Bard’s children’s tales. In the muggle world, literacy is equally as important. Job seekers with low literacy skills struggle to find work and low-reading parents are often unable to help their children with school work. Researchers have even found that people with low literacy skills are more likely to wait until they are very sick to seek medical care and are less likely to participate in disease prevention activities, which contributes to rising healthcare costs. Overall, low literacy levels and the resulting complications are major contributors to economic inequality. When a huge portion of the population struggles to read a job application or understand a prescription label, it is clear that the odds are not in our favor.

Harry Potter fans know the difference a good book can make – and so do researchers. Studies show that early access to books can improve children’s reading habits, but schools and libraries in underprivileged communities have fewer books to go around. That’s where you come in. When you donate to the Apparating Library in the Brightmoor Community Center, you are putting more books into the eager hands of young Detroiters. Accio Books! is about more than giving away books. It is about spreading the power of story in communities that need it the most. Whether you donate one or one hundred books this year, you are adding a little more magic to the world. The more magic there is in the world – the more education and passion and creative solutions we cultivate – the closer we get to the day when the odds really are in everyone’s favor.

Books of all types can be mailed directly to:

The Apparating Library
℅ Brightmoor Community Center
14451 Burt Rd.
Detroit, MI 48223

"1789","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","""'The Fault in Our Stars' is at its core a love story between two teenagers. My sister never got to have a relationship like that. She got to experience just a few weeks of being 16. Witnessing a life and a romance she could have had made me feel unbearably sad and yet, oddly, uplifted. It’s as if, through Hazel, my sister is able to continue having new experiences. As if she got a sequel.

""I can vouch that my sister’s life was filled with other forms of love. Having a support group to bolster her, having an online community to socialize with, helped Esther to smile and press on. She was one of five siblings, all of us extremely close. (Whereas Hazel is an only child, texting below the dinner table while her parents carry on a conversation.) When John Green promised to make Esther Day videos for my sister’s birthday each year, she asked him to make the day about “family and love.” Esther encouraged us as a family to never hesitate to say “I love you,” to express ourselves honestly, to hug and laugh.""

Esther Earl's sister, Evangeline, wrote an incredible article about Esther and The Fault in Our Stars for the Washington Post. The full story is linked below.

Our new campaign, the Esther Day Project, seeks to celebrate Esther's vision for a holiday about platonic love.

Our conference, held October 17 to 19, 2014, is designed to bring our greatest leaders together in one place and allow them to establish strong connections with each other, share ideas, learn from our talented staff, and emerge well-equipped to lead their community to a more just and magical future. Of course, this will be no ordinary leadership conference, as all programming and activities will be injected with the spirit of our most cherished stories. Whether most inspired by Hermione’s community organizing chops or Neville’s ability to stand up for what’s right regardless of the risk, attendees will be given the tools to become the heroes of their own narrative!

Registration for Granger Leadership Academy is $40 and includes all programming, keynote speakers, and a fanciful catered dinner on Saturday night.

All conference activity will occur at The Hotel at Auburn University. Rooms at the hotel will be available to attendees for $119 per night, and will hold up to four people. Attendees should plan to make their room reservations by September 26, 2014. We have secured a room block for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights.

Attendees should make their room reservations using the following link:
https://bookings.ihotelier.com/The-Hotel-at-Auburn-University/bookings.jsp?hotelID=6493&groupID=1248984

Friday Morning: Individual (Self)
Friday Afternoon: Group (Chapter)

Instead, Nerdfighters should be acknowledged as a self-standing online community, meaningful both as a source of friendship and support for young people, and as a site for civic learning and action. Nerdfighters simply call it ""decreasing world suck.""

Nerdfighters are a creative and unorthodox bunch, as likely to be playing a hand-made ukulele as they are to be shooting the next installment of their collective video-blog on YouTube.

Unlike what the media coverage may suggest, Nerdfighters aren't just ""fans of John Green"" (or his brother Hank, who for Nerdfighters holds the same celebrity status). The Green brothers are only one common ground uniting Nerdfighters.

Rather, Nerdfighteria is a place where young people meet like-minded others, and can proudly let their ""inner nerd"" shine. It is a place where they can share their most intimate worries and concerns. Just as Esther shared her struggles with cancer, other Nerdfighters share the problems they face, such as their parents' divorce, battling depression, or uncertainties around their sexual identities.""

Maybe you've heard about this thing called Net Neutrality. 

It's the idea that once you've paid for your internet service, you should have equal access to the entire internet: from your favorite independent YouTube creators and to streaming services like Netflix or Hulu. 

But internet service providers (ISPs) want that to end. They want to be able to charge the content creators to get onto your computer screens: a service that you’ve already paid for. 

This is a big week in the fight to preserve Net Neutrality. 

The FCC’s public comment period ends this Friday. 

Take a few minutes to watch our friend Hank Green’s video on net neutrality and sign this petition which sends comments directly to the FCC.

Here’s to book seven. Here’s to the years of anticipation before it and the years of discussion in its wake. Here’s to the boy who lived and how he changed everything.

And here’s to you, if you know that “the very end” isn't happening anytime soon.

We are book eight.

--

Seven years ago, the world said it was the end of an era. News outlets prepared for what they thought - and perhaps hoped - would be their final coverage of the Harry Potter phenomenon. While small bookstores celebrated alongside readers, big box stores were gearing up for “one last midnight release.”

Seven years ago, we knew better. We were ready. We were decked out from head to toe, friends new and old by our side and wand at the ready. Maybe we were lining up, filling stores and sidewalks with our excited chatter, shutting down Harvard Yard with our music movement, pushing our favorite fansites’ servers to their limits. We were loud because we knew the rest of the night would be spent in silence. We knew we’d be reading well into daylight. And we did.

Despite that, parts of us were scared that - beyond all reason - they were right. Scared that it would inexplicably fizzle out, that this would be the last time, that we’d reunite briefly for the remaining movies and then move on. We knew this wouldn’t happen, but fear resists reason and we were scared.

Seven years later, we’re still going strong and it’s easy to laugh at those fleeting concerns. It’s easier still to forget that we made this happen. We made conscious decisions to keep the Harry Potter community alive, to talk about what we’d just read and wonder what would happen next. Even when the first wave of discussion died down, the fandom went on. We hadn’t stopped loving Harry Potter. We’d only just begun.

Seven years ago, the Harry Potter Alliance was still just starting out. We’s made some big strides and had some - okay, more than just some - big ideas. In the time since then, you’ve helped us make some incredible moments possible. There are already too many campaigns, discussions, and memories to nail down in one tidy list. This fandom’s commitment to Harry Potter and each other is what made those big ideas possible and makes them possible still.

Today, we’ll be celebrating the book that brought us all together - not for the first time and not for the last - seven years ago.

But first, we want to celebrate this community: the one that saw Harry through until the very end, the one that already has new things to count down to, the one that knows know what it knew then.

Today, we know that there are at least three new Harry Potter movies ahead of us. We know that there will be a play about Harry's early days. There are even whispers of a new book or something equally momentous under J.K. Rowling's sleeve.

But none of those are the eighth book. The Harry Potter series was not succeeded by the news of a theme park attraction or Pottermore. It was succeeded by the same community that saw it through.

We’ve spent our summer apparating from one con to another, so our physical merch table has been pretty busy. Thanks to wizard science and our friends at DFTBA Records, however, all our wizard wearables (including shirts for people and walls) are also available through the internet. We’ve even gotten the Ministry of Magic to let us lift all the charms on it and make it available beyond the Floo Network.

Now you can rep the internet with our Hogwarts Internet Club and Grangr t-shirts. There’s also our super-swanky Books Turn Muggles Into Wizards journal, which we promise is not a horcrux. And if you’re in need of some encouragement, you can hang the Hang in There, Baby Crookshanks poster on your wall for instant, furry moral support.

These are the latest in our merch line, which includes some of our old favorites like the Granger/Lovegood 2016 campaign tee and our classy HPA logo shirt. So classy.

We’d love to see you at our booths and tables across the country (LeakyCon Orlando, anyone?), but the internet’s got your back if you can’t make it.

Each purchase helps support our work at the Harry Potter Alliance. So thanks!

Feel free to buy all the things.

"1677","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","We are deeply saddened by Robin Williams’ passing and join the world in mourning him.

When the people who help us fight off dementors fall victim to their effects, hope and happiness can seem almost unattainable. We are all so indebted to the entertainers of the world that it seems only logical that the universe should give at least a fraction of their brightness back to them. Instead, they too often face darkness so deep that remembering to turn on the light isn’t always an option.

Robin Williams’ work as a comedian, actor, and philanthropist reached millions. Whether it was as Genie, John Keating, Peter Pan, Theodore Roosevelt, or just as Robin, he brought the world a unique and invaluable happiness. It was he who said that “comedy is acting out optimism.” Though the world knew him for that optimism, behind the scenes he was battling his own dementors.

These moments of shock give us the chance to move forward with open minds and open hearts. For so many, seeking help is an insurmountable task. Having people listen and understand can be the strongest patronus there is.

As we navigate this difficult news, we can work to make the truth stronger by speaking more honestly and listening more openly. We can honor Robin Williams by driving out not just our own dementors, but each others’.

The weapon we have is love.

You’ve heard all these rumblings about Net Neutrality over the past several months. Let’s get real: this is about controlling online video. It is estimated that by 2017, video content will account for 80-90% of all global Internet traffic (1). 

This isn’t just about not being able to binge-watch a series on Netflix. It’s about the future of online video as we know it.

Whether your YouTube channel is home to daily vlogs, short films, or just that one video from when the cinnamon challenge seemed like a good idea, you’re a video creator. Your content and comments help shape this community. Let’s keep it that way.

Net Neutrality means that your YouTube videos reach people at the same speed as clips from last night’s episode of the Tonight Show. It means a level playing field for video creators looking to reach an audience. But new Net Neutrality rules could mess that up. 

Here’s the deal: Telecommunications companies already charge us to access the Internet through our homes and our phones. New FCC rules could allow them to also charge content providers (like YouTube, Netflix, and even PBS) for access to our eyeballs. It could create a fast lane for Jimmy Fallon’s clips, and slow lane for your YouTube videos. 

It is really important that the FCC understands that online video creators care about Net Neutrality. Even if you’ve only ever uploaded ONE VIDEO, you are a creator and you have a voice. 

If you can, please add your channel to our petition. We’ll deliver this to the FCC in September and demonstrate that the online video community cares about this issue. 

Sign the petition here, then spread the word: http://www.videocreatorsfornetneutrality.org/

At the Harry Potter Alliance, we know stories can change the world. We know we can become the heroes we read about. We know books are magic.

We know these things because we've seen them at work. Together, the Harry Potter community has raised over 150,000 books for underserved and underpriviliged communities around the world and swapped books across oceans.

There's no better way to honor that something very magical J.K. Rowling spoke about than to see it through. There's no better way to celebrate literacy than to spread it.","2014-09-08T14:00:00+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/thehpalliance/photos/a.10150112250908111.280078.334095623110/10152390683533111/?type=3","334095623110_10152390683533111",NA,1436,9,250,2014-09-08 10:00:00,"2014-09","2014","Monday","10:00",10,"8AM to 11AM",100,1000,"10"

The world is better off with the Potter Puppet Pals in them. Whether you've only seen Mysterious Ticking Noise or consider yourself a seasoned puppet historian, it's clear that these puppets could probably take over the world. Instead, they make people laugh. We're happy they're here, and we're happy we can get our PPP fix whenever we want to just by going to their channel. We want it to stay that way.

If big cable companies had their way, content would stop being equally accessible. For YouTubers, uploading videos would be next to impossible to begin with and we’d have to wait hours just to watch one video. Meanwhile, network television clips and dodgy advertisements would get priority access to your eyeballs.

"1496","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","We’re celebrating Indigenous People’s Day in affirmation of what should be self-evident: much of what we know and enjoy has been made possible by atrocities committed against others. In order to truly move forward, we must acknowledge these crimes and make whatever reparations are possible.

Christopher Columbus’ “discovery” of America was followed by the genocide and enslavement of tens of millions of native people. His actions led to the transatlantic slave trade and centuries of violence and discrimination towards indigenous people. Yet we celebrate him as an American hero.

Vondell Swain’s incredible Harry Potter art has been making waves in the fandom for months, creating important discussions about how we read fiction and why diverse representation is vital. We’ve long been fans of Vondell’s art, which is why so excited to announce that his James, Lily, and Harry Potter pieces are available as buttons exclusively through Equality FTW!

Vondell explains, “Personally I’m mentally acting against the white-as-default-unless-otherwise-specified that’s pervasive in imagining media especially in predominantly white fandom culture. In absence of a specified race I chose to imagine the one that makes the story most compelling to me.”

The Harry Potter Alliance turns fans into heroes, fighting for equality with the stories we love at the core of each campaign. Fan activism is growing and accomplishing new things each day, so it’s more important than ever that we fight for equality not just inspired by fiction, but within it.

This fundraiser helps us keep fighting for equality. It ends this Saturday.

Mockingjay Part 1, the third film in the Hunger Games series, premieres this week. With all eyes on this game-changing story, it’s the perfect time to take back the narrative.

The Hunger Games explores themes of economic inequality and government corruption that parallel issues prevalent in our world. It would do the trilogy a great disservice to disregard that commentary, to gossip about relationships and appearances, to capitalize off the shock value. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what’s happening.

So we’re taking this into our own hands.

We want to hear your stories - the daily realities, the struggles, and the triumphs big and small. The ways race, gender, sexual orientation, bodily status, familial origin, and more intersect and inform how you’re treated. Economic inequality manifests itself in our daily lives and yet even alluding to it is frowned upon. Now is the time to shine a light on it.

Let’s do just that. Share your stories. Own your experiences. See how the catharsis of telling your truth can educate, empower, and effect change. If the gamemakers are going to perpetuate the culture of silence, it’s up to us to raise our voice.

Tell your story here or by tweeting, instragramming, making a video - whatever you do, tag it #MyHungerGames to include it in the discussion. We’ll be highlighting our favorites here and on our We Are The Districts blog (http://wearethedistricts.tumblr.com).

Let’s shift the odds into our favor.","2014-11-17T13:56:56+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/thehpalliance/photos/a.10150112250908111.280078.334095623110/10152534250043111/?type=3","334095623110_10152534250043111",NA,489,7,70,2014-11-17 08:56:56,"2014-11","2014","Monday","08:56",8,"8AM to 11AM",64,512,"8"

For those unaware, the series is set in a dystopic future North American region called Panem, where one very rich and powerful class (The Capitol) rules over the majority of the population — a population that has been divided into 13 increasingly oppressed, disenfranchised and impoverished districts.

[…]

Since the hashtag was launched last week, nearly 5,000 people have used it to share their own stories of economic inequality on Twitter. Hundreds more have turned to Tumblr with the hashtag to explain just how much the issue has affected their own lives.”

We are thankful for your constant support, your contributions to important discussions, your commitment to both unironic enthusiasm and social change. We are thankful that our ever-growing membership is so eager to change the world in positive, compassionate ways. We are thankful that we can continue to work alongside you.

And we hope you’re thankful, too - that you are enjoying the privilege and necessity of gratitude with those you love, whether it be around a dinner table or through the internet.

But we cannot celebrate today without acknowledging all of its implications. We cannot pretend that this holiday or the nation that celebrates it was built ethically or even harmlessly. We cannot forget the atrocities perpetrated against Native Americans at its origin, and we cannot ignore the ongoing epidemic of often lethal violence against black people. Our history and present are fraught with injustice; if we hope to change the future, we must remember this.

While we welcome the opportunity to celebrate and engage in gratitude, it cannot overshadow the need for consciousness and change. Today we are thankful, but we’re also thoughtful, mournful and - ultimately - hopeful.","2014-11-27T16:00:01+0000","status",NA,"334095623110_10152552134068111",NA,305,7,5,2014-11-27 11:00:01,"2014-11","2014","Thursday","11:00",11,"8AM to 11AM",121,1331,"11"

As we process the devastating news that a New York City grand jury has decided Eric Garner’s murder unworthy of a fair trial, our hearts are heavy. We send all those mourning him love and light.

Days like today are never easy and never welcome, but they are common. They were common centuries ago, common in the civil rights movement we pretend is a distant past, and common still. The need for change is urgent and overwhelming. All of us must play our part in fighting against the decriminalization of racially-motivated murder. All of us must do what we can.

We thank and commend all those joining the movement to demand change. Whether it be by onsite protest or online discussion, your voices matter. You are making a difference.

Along with Mike Brown, Tamir Rice, and the long list of stories like 
theirs, Eric Garner is on our minds as we go forward from this moment.","2014-12-04T00:15:35+0000","status",NA,"334095623110_10152564630968111",NA,646,29,56,2014-12-03 19:15:35,"2014-12","2014","Wednesday","19:15",19,"4PM to 7PM",361,6859,"19"

Economic inequality is not an isolated issue. It intersects and overlaps with race, gender, sexuality, health - the list goes on. As we fight to shift the odds in our favor, it's vital that we keep that in mind.

""We all know how strong and sometimes terrifying fandoms can be. You could go on twitter today and post a picture of a kid from Target bagging your purchase and you would get so many followers and an entire fandom will come out of it in a matter of hours. I mean, this just shows the power of fandom - on social media especially - today. Now, think - if only we could harness this energy that’s in fandoms and use it for a good cause.

Lucky for the world, we don’t have to imagine such a thing.In 2005, a group of eager fans of a particular boy wizard saw the global inequalities of the world and became witches and wizards themselves to make a difference through their fandom. The Harry Potter Alliance came out of this ideal.

They’ve produced many successful campaigns covering topics of illiteracy, homophobia, child slavery, the climate crisis, and many more. In 2014 alone, the Harry Potter Alliance’s annual fundraiser Equality FTW raised over $150,000 to help fund another year of fan activism. This includes working for economic, educational, and LGBTQ equality. The Equality FTW fundraiser hits very close to home for me as someone part of the LGBTQ community. And honestly, who doesn’t love an excuse to celebrate Harry Potter in the process?”","2014-12-12T23:40:58+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/thehpalliance/photos/a.10150112250908111.280078.334095623110/10152584042058111/?type=3","334095623110_10152584042058111",NA,887,1,16,2014-12-12 18:40:58,"2014-12","2014","Friday","18:40",18,"4PM to 7PM",324,5832,"18"

We have been honored to work with Paul on a day-to-day basis for the past two years and look forward to seeing the weird and amazing things he creates next. Good luck on your immortal adventures with Stephen Colbert and Santa Claus, Paul. We’ll meet again some sunny day.

=====

Today I’m stepping down as Executive Director of the Harry Potter Alliance.

As I’ve been preparing for this, a lot of friends and family have expressed either curiosity or dismay at my decision. Why would I leave this amazing job? It’s a great question to ask and one I’ve wrestled with for quite some time. The truth is, I don’t have a spectacularly great answer for it, at least not in the conventional sense. I’m not leaving this job for another. Instead, I’m leaving because I’m curious to see what happens. It’s a challenge to myself to keep pushing forward, to keep learning, to keep experimenting and to keep creating. It’s a personal decision to embrace that next adventure. I will, however, continue to stay involved with the HPA as a member of the Board of Directors.

As a co-founder of the Harry Potter Alliance, it’s difficult to express the pride I feel for this organization. Over the past 10 years, I’ve played an intimate role in shaping this organization and that feels like such a privilege. Like any non-profit, the HPA started with an idea. But it’s been my experience that ideas only become reality when they’re nurtured and championed by talented, ambitious and dedicated people. In that respect, I am so grateful to everyone who has helped this organization over the years: our board members, our staff members, our volunteers, our chapter organizers, our members, our partners and everyone else who at one time or another has counted themselves as an ally to the HPA. Thank you all.

I know this is all starting to sound a bit bittersweet, but let me assure you it’s not. It’s just plain sweet. The Harry Potter Alliance is currently operating at the top of its game and I’ve never been more confident in its continued success. Earlier this year we completed a year-long strategic planning process and we’ve assembled an amazing team that is incredibly committed to our mission and ready to bring this plan forward. It’s a plan that will allow the HPA to continue redefining fandom and will turn “fan activism” into a household phrase.

I’m excited to announce that a key member of this team is our new Executive Director, Matthew Maggiacomo. You may know Matt as the human host body for the wizard rock band the Whomping Willows, but he’s also served as a longtime board member for the HPA. A year and a half ago, he left our board and joined our staff as our Chapters Director. In that time, we’ve seen unprecedented growth in our chapters program, particularly at a global level. We now have nearly 300 active HPA chapters (up from 120) in 43 states and 25 countries: each doing amazing work in their local communities. We’ve also created the Granger Leadership Academy, a weekend long training conference for chapter organizers and fan activists. All of this has happened under Matt’s leadership and I can’t wait to see what he does at the helm of the entire organization.

It has been such an honor to serve as the Executive Director of the Harry Potter Alliance. We’re on the cusp of major victories in Net Neutrality and in our Not In Harry’s Name campaign, and our recent work around the Hunger Games has transformed the cultural dialogue around economic inequality. I’m so proud of the work that our community has done in the name of equality and social justice. Thank you to everyone who has been a part of that work over the past nine and a half years.

Hedwig Lives,

"1245","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","As we observe Martin Luther King Jr. Day, we must take time to reflect and commit ourselves to progressive, compassionate change.

This holiday is, yes, one to celebrate - a day to consider the triumphs of the Civil Rights movements, the revolutionary contributions of black activists and artists, the story of everything that has led to today. But that cannot be all that it is. We cannot welcome the false sense of achievement we’ve been taught to slip into on the third Monday of every January. To do so would be to discredit the daily demonstrations demanding basic rights, deny the dangerous failings of the system, and diminish the mourning that weighs on communities that have come to know the realities of racism all too well.

We must regard today with solace and solemnity rather than with victory. And we must keep moving forward.

We must listen to firsthand accounts of oppression and marginalization. We must allow these stories to inform our worldview and advocacy. We must advocate vocally, but never speak for or over the group of the hour. We must speak and act with compassion, conscious of the power and privilege we carry. We must strive to educate ourselves. We must demand equality consistently and completely. 

We must do these things in King’s memory, yes, but also in Mike Brown’s, in Tamir Rice’s, in Sheneque Proctor’s - the list, to our great sorrow, goes on. And we must do these things with the urgent hope that together we can shift the tides and create a tomorrow where this is no longer our normal.

In his book recounting the Montgomery bus boycott, King wrote: ""Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. Even a superficial look at history reveals that no social advance rolls in on the wheels inevitability. Every step towards the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering, and struggle; the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals. [...] This is no time for apathy or complacency. This is a time for vigorous and positive action.""

Ferguson Action has organized #ReclaimMLK to take back a legacy that has been “clouded by efforts to soften, sanitize, and commercialize it.” Their vision is that “from here on, MLK weekend will be known as a time of national resistance to injustice.” You can learn more about these efforts and find other resources here: http://fergusonaction.com/movement/. Other celebrations include MTV’s decision to air all programming in black and white and the Selma cast and crew’s commemorative march from Selma to Montgomery.

Please join us in observing this holiday with remembrance, reflection, and action.","2015-01-19T18:41:44+0000","status",NA,"334095623110_10152686421213111",NA,309,1,30,2015-01-19 13:41:44,"2015-01","2015","Monday","13:41",13,"12PM to 3PM",169,2197,"13"

We were referenced in a list of campaigns that have seen success while protests in the wake of police brutality and systemic violence against black lives have yet to see change or justice.

In the landscape of activism today, it is vital to recognize that many victories are owed in part to a certain privilege. The #BlackLivesMatter protests have not received the coverage or attention they need and deserve, and this radio silence is too easily accepted by the general public. Every success must come with the realization that, in these matters, no silence is accidental and all silence is harmful.

Even as we celebrate the Not in Harry’s Name victory referenced in the Nightly Show, we continue to stand with protesters from Ferguson to New York and around the world. Protest is powerful, and continued protest is resilient. Larry Wilmore’s segment is a reminder that protest works. We encourage you to join the movement, refuse to accept its erasure, and be part of its inevitable and necessary success.","2015-01-20T17:14:04+0000","link","http://www.cc.com/video-clips/wli9ro/the-nightly-show-state-of-the-black-protest?time=3m00s&fb_ref=fbshare_web","334095623110_10152688345663111",NA,100,2,2,2015-01-20 12:14:04,"2015-01","2015","Tuesday","12:14",12,"12PM to 3PM",144,1728,"12"

We have heard the reports of increased violence against Muslims.

Since early February, Rowling has been favoriting pro-diversity thinkpieces and fanart alike, including Harry Potter Alliance Press Coordinator Alanna Bennett’s incredible Buzzfeed article (give it a read: http://www.buzzfeed.com/alannabennett/what-a-racebent-hermione-granger-really-represen-d2yp#.pwwOM8zxy)

Yeah. We’re flipping out, too. Even beyond this being a nod to one of our awesome volunteers, it’s a big sign that J.K. Rowling supports the growing movement of fans imagining their favorite characters complexly and diversely. Here’s hoping this is a precursor to J.K. Rowling becoming a more vocal supporter of diversity in popular fiction.

This is a huge win that’s going to protect the internet in very important ways. Our organization and the communities it calls home are all based out of the internet; today’s victory means it can stay that way for everybody.

We’ve been lucky enough to work with several awesome organizations to help make this happen. Part of that involved the Video Creators for Net Neutrality petition, which brought together hundreds of thousands of people to defend the content they create and consume. Big thanks go out to everybody who signed and spread the word.

We’re super stoked about the good news and hope you are, too. You can join the celebrations by talking about it (check out #NetNeutrality on the twitter in particular), continuing to watch your favorite YouTube channels, working your way through your Netflix to-watch list, blogging about things you love, speaking your mind, and making things.

With your help, this campaign will fund Accio Books - our annual international book drive - and help us take it to new levels. Since our first Accio Books campaign in 2009, we’ve raised over 200,000 books for schools and communities in need and 
built libraries in Brooklyn and Rwanda. We've also created the Apparating Library, a progressive, community-generated library built by HPA members across the world over the course of several major fandom events, and organized the first Apparating Library book giveaway event in Detroit in 2014. There, thousands of books were distributed to families in need at the Brightmoor Community Center.

We're getting ready to do it all again this year, with TWO Apparating Library giveaways on two different continents and our most ambitious goal yet. But we need your help to do it.

The Harry Potter Alliance is unique in that 90% of our funding comes from our members, many of whom are part of literature-based fandoms. We don’t rely on the Malfoys of the world for big donations. We are built from the support of everyday fans like you.

To say thank you for your donations, we have a bunch of awesome perks available. This includes generous donations from our partners - books signed by Neil Gaiman, a compilation of songs about books by artists like Hank Green and Lauren Fairweather, GeekyCon exclusives that will help you skip the lines or get behind-the-scenes access at the event of the year, and more. We also have lots of in-house perks, from rad t-shirts to registration for the unparalleled Granger Leadership Academy conference. Each donation includes a Friends of the Apparating Library Membership, which will get you into our exciting new book club.

"1159","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","The HPA and Glee go way back. Many of our staffers remember the days of slushies and blazers a little too well. Especially in its first few years, we drew a lot of inspiration from Glee. Tonight, we want to take a moment to reflect on how thankful we are for that.

It was, as all of tumblr will readily tell you, a deeply imperfect show; its misses probably outnumbered its hits, and even its hits were always a little off-target. Still, Glee made great strides towards the kind of representation we need in our media. Things were very different when the pilot premiered. Glee didn’t cause the victories and steady progress in the six years between then and now, but it did help things along in its own way. The stories it told were ones the world needed - ones it still needs. As those stories finally start making their way into other shows, we can’t help but remember how it felt to see them play out in that choir room.

And, of course, Glee was - is - very important to the communities we call home. We’ve partnered with several of the show’s actors and are so grateful for their help. We see the breadth and depth of Glee’s influence every summer when we spend a weekend with people the show has helped bring together. Even those of us who didn’t see the show through sing along a little louder to a few songs - you know exactly which ones -  every single time out of an unshakeable bias.

Tonight, we’re thinking of Glee and its cast; we’re thinking of the people we lost along the way; more than anything, though, we’re thinking of you. Whether you jumped ship a few seasons in or rode it out until the end, whether you’ll be packing pink sunglasses and Dalton Academy ties in your summer con bags or pretending you never owned either, whether you saw yourself in this television show or you saw yourself in its fans, we’re glad you were here.

Keep loving imperfect things. Keep asking more of them. Keep making art about them. Keep being unapologetic in your love and enthusiasm for them no matter how much ratings drop. Keep making friends and memories that outlast them.

Don’t stop believing.","2015-03-21T00:41:43+0000","status",NA,"334095623110_10152808123588111",NA,599,12,39,2015-03-20 20:41:43,"2015-03","2015","Friday","20:41",20,"8PM to 11PM",400,8000,"20"

This is important - and if you use the internet at all, it’s important to you specifically. The architects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership are intent on fast-tracking the massive trade agreement through Congress, probably because they understand that the devil’s in the details and it’s in their best interest to fend off scrutiny.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership would: 1) damage the FCC’s ability to enforce new net neutrality rules, 2) make it easier for telecoms to create prioritized fast lanes for specific content providers, 3) tighten restrictions on fair use of copyrighted materials, potentially harming artistic expression across all social media platforms and content creation hubs - from Facebook to YouTube to Reddit, 4) put more power into the hands of giant corporations, facilitating their avoidance of crucial environmental protocol and basic protections for workers, 5) increase the ability of corporations to fight back against whistleblowers and media entities that expose corporate abuse of power.

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

You can help stop this from happening.

We’ve been gearing up to make this a summer of healthy, positive fandom. We have several campaigns, events, and activities coming up that will revolve around celebrating and improving the communities we live in.

As part of our upcoming Positive Fandom campaign, we want to establish some guidelines about how to be part of these communities and how to approach different situations. Our senior staff put together an initial draft that was then edited by our volunteer staff, Uplift, and some of our partners. Because we think everyone in the community should have a say in how it’s led, we want to open up the editing process to you, too.

Fandom is something very close to our hearts - not just because of what it celebrates, but because of what it creates. From fanfiction to fanart, fanworks mean that canon is only ever the beginning. Even when a series is ongoing, fans create art that fills in holes and bridges gaps, often adding layers and diversity where they’re needed most.

Like all great and powerful things, though, there are people who take issue with it. We want to fight for fanworks, and we want to do it with you.

Starting right now you can visit fanworksarefairuse.org, where we’ll be working together to make sure that any upcoming copyright and trademark laws are ones that protect and support your reimagining of beloved stories. Whether you create them or consume them, then you know better than anyone that fanworks are valuable and deserves a community to protect it.

We also want to celebrate what fanworks have done for us and our friends where the whole world can see it. You can join in by using the hashtag #FanWorksTaughtMe. Here are some examples:

- #FanWorksTaughtMe to think critically about my identity and how that is (or isn’t) reflected in the media.
- I made some of my closest friends through beta-ing fanfiction. #FanWorksTaughtMe
- #FanWorksTaughtMe to step out of my shell by cosplaying at cons.

It’s time to show the world that your creations and and the work you love matter.

Our hearts are with those affected by the Charleston shooting: the victims, their loved ones, the people at home who have seen this unfold time and time again. We send all of you love and light.

We would love to tack on a “stay safe” for all those shaken in the wake of this attack, but this is another in a long list of jarring reminders that safety is not simple and not always attainable. No life should ever be taken, but attacks in safe spaces like churches are uniquely harrowing.

It is not on you to stay safe. It is on those who make you fear for your safety to stop doing so. It is on all of us to do our part to make safety a given instead of an unrealistic platitude.

So we will say this: we are thinking of you. We are hoping you are safe. We stand with you. We urge you to come together and draw strength from each other.

For those of us who live outside this fear: it is vital that we stay informed, stay supportive, and do what we can to spread the word. This act of terrorism is symptomatic of problems embedded deeply into our society, and our awareness of that and commitment to dismantle institutionalized racism must be as present in the discussion as our mourning. We must amplify voices, raise awareness, and dig our heels in to work towards a time where this is unthinkable instead of expected.

The weapon we have is love.","2015-06-18T17:04:05+0000","status",NA,"334095623110_10153001464023111",NA,1017,22,150,2015-06-18 13:04:05,"2015-06","2015","Thursday","13:04",13,"12PM to 3PM",169,2197,"13"

"1001","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","A co-founder of the Harry Potter Alliance, Andrew has served as our Executive Director and President. Today, he’s announcing his departure as an HPA employee with this message:

“Dear fellow members of the Harry Potter Alliance,

In the wake of our Not In Harry’s Name chocolate frog victory with Warner Bros., I was in Iceland. Iceland is a magical place where they believe in elves (and as such, are more respectful of the environment, not wanting to destroy the homes of any elves). As I was trekking in this otherworldly landscape at the ends of the earth, peering into the heart of magnificent glaciers that are tragically melting, something dawned on me:

I need to stay both a leader and board member of the HPA. But after ten years, I need to leave the payroll as an employee.

If the HPA is the Dumbledore’s Army of our world, then it is time for me to create our own Order of the Phoenix. Doing so will allow the HPA to truly transform the world by imagining better.

Standing in Iceland, peering into the heart of that magical country, I knew in my heart what needed to happen. And like magic, Micah Sirfry - a mentor of mine - offered me a job at his new one-of-a-kind Civic Hall upon my return to the United States. Pretty incredible coincidence! I am going to be Civic Hall’s first fellow in Civic Imagination.

My task, essentially, is to continue working with the HPA on campaigns like Odds In Our Favor and to start entirely new campaigns, including a forthcoming campaign on Star Wars to get the Empire that is Big Money to no longer aim its Death Star at democracy. And there’s more: by 2016, we’ll be announcing programs like Imagine Better Learning that seek to reinvent education in a way that is centered on the imagination. For more, please go here.

So while leaving the employ of the HPA, I am in no way leaving the community. And I’m leaving knowing that our Executive Director Matt Maggiacomo, the other members of our Senior Staff, our volunteer staff, our over 250 chapters in 30 countries, and our members - Wizard Activists like you - will carry this torch together. That in dark and difficult times we will continue to choose what is right over what is easy, continue to approach fantasy not as an escape from our world but as an invitation to go deeper into it, and continue to realize that we are the eighth book. And - as the eighth book - that we will strive to remember that our job is not to save the world, but to fall in love with it.

As we do, there will be more victories like Not In Harry’s Name. As we do, all of us on this precious planet will come together and embrace the notion that the human race does not need to have a tragic ending to our story. Instead, we get to choose our next adventure.

And while it feels dramatic to no longer be on the payroll of the HPA, it’s more of a technicality than anything else. I look forward to more adventures together as we work to destroy every one of our world’s most intractable horcruxes in the name of justice, magic, and - most of all - love.

Until then, after ten years, it’s pretty fun to say mischief managed. And yet, at the same time, to not be truly leaving you but joining you… to still being up to no good.

Thank you for ten years of wonderment, friendship, and social change. Here’s to ten more!

The Weapon We Have Is Love,

Andrew Slack

In 2005, Andrew Slack had a wild idea: what if we could harness the passion of fandom into creating social change? Ten years later, we can confidently say we’re doing just that. To celebrate this milestone, we’re taking ten weeks to look at the incredible ways that the HPA has helped turn fans into heroes.

The road to wizard activism has been filled with twists and turns and from now until our birthday on October 10th, we’ll be exploring this awesome journey with you. Each week, we’ll look back at a year in HPA history. Follow along on our roadmap and see where ten years of wizard activism has led us!

The HPA was just an ickle firstie in 2005, but we were already doing big things. In May, we had our first social media page (on MySpace), and its popularity led Andrew, along with his comedy partner Seth Soulstein and Paul DeGeorge of Harry and the Potters, to begin sketching out a formal plan for the HPA. By October, we were hosting our first wizard rock concert to raise money for Amnesty International. The annual Yule Ball later that year served as the HPA’s first fundraiser, and the first of many celebrations to come.

We’ll be sharing even more throwbacks over the next ten weeks as we lead up to our tenth anniversary on October 10th. And if you want to help us continue kicking butt for another ten years, you can donate $10 - one for each year of awesome - at http://thehpalliance.org/donate. This milestone would not have been possible without your support. Thank you.","2015-08-07T23:58:32+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/thehpalliance/photos/a.10153262371403111.1073741834.334095623110/10153115947173111/?type=3","334095623110_10153115947173111","The Harry Potter Alliance added a new photo to the album: HPA10.",210,1,11,2015-08-07 19:58:32,"2015-08","2015","Friday","19:58",19,"4PM to 7PM",361,6859,"19"

""When I started writing fanfiction and when I started recording my own wizard rock music, I was kind of a broken version of myself hidden in this shell - I was terrified to really be who I was. Online, I could be who I knew I was on the inside and who I was just terrified to show to everyone else. So a lot of my high school career involved trying to fit in with everybody and then going home and needing that online time - that creative time - to sort of be me again. I noticed that I stopped worrying what people thought about me and that I would rather have people not like it or not understand it than having to hide it from everyone.""

The heartbreaking images that have been spread across the internet represent a handful of stories out of millions. When faced with these truths, problems can seem larger than life and certainly too large for us to know how to help. As always, though, there is incredibly strength in numbers. Thousands of people - including many young adult authors - have rallied around Patrick Ness's fundraising efforts benefitting Save the Children. Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been raised already, with most donations being matched.

If you are looking for ways to help, donating to and/or spreading the word about this effort is a fantastic option.

"951","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","It's been an incredible ten years for the HPA. Join us in our next adventure at hpa10.com - this Dumbledore's Army needs your help.

Ten is a big number.

When Harry Potter was ten, he was about to receive the letter that would change his life. The Tenth Doctor took the universe by storm with the power of story. And this October marks ten years of the Harry Potter Alliance.

We’re eagerly inviting you to celebrate with us by supporting our tenth anniversary fundraiser, which launches today.

As we’ve approached this milestone, we’ve spent lots of time looking back at what we’ve done in the past ten years thanks to this community’s generosity and commitment to decreasing worldsuck. The HPA has gone from cofounder Andrew Slack’s wild idea to an organization with countless accomplishments - ones like sending five planes full of supplies to Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake, collecting hundreds of thousands of books for underserved communities, creating over 250 chapters across six continents and 30 countries, getting Warner Bros. to stop using chocolate sourced from child slavery in its Harry Potter products and so much more.

Mostly, though, we’re looking to the future. Not just because we’ll finally have the hoverboards we were promised by movies, but because we know we have more possibilities ahead of us than ever.

When we were just starting out back in 2005, we couldn’t have imagined what the next decade would hold. We had big plans and a bigger drive, but none of it could hold a candle to reality. Now, in 2015, that hasn’t changed.

Going forward, some of our plans look like this: We will continue our annual Accio Books campaign until we’ve raised one million books and built 25 libraries across the world. We will renew our commitment to the LGBTQIA+ community with a campaign to support trans rights and fight individual and government-sanctioned bullying. We will work with our friends at Uplift to grow our Positive Fandom movement and improve fandom spaces for women, LGBTQIA+ communities, people of color, disabled people, and other populations that have been marginalized in conventional fandom spaces. We will soon launch the third and final phase of Odds in Our Favor, which will focus on amplifying the voices of a diverse set of communities impacted by economic inequality. We will grow Granger Leadership Academy into a large-scale fan activist training ground that will revolutionize leadership development. We will continue to transform fandom into a space for social good, individual empowerment, and community-wide collaboration.

As with our first ten years, the next ten years of the HPA will only be possible because of you: your support, your enthusiasm, and your donations. The HPA10 fundraiser is our way of kicking off the next decade.

Your support is especially helpful in the fundraiser’s early days, so please donate and spread the word today and join us for our launch livestream tonight!

Here’s to ten years and loads more.","2015-09-10T19:04:37+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/thehpalliance/photos/a.10153262371403111.1073741834.334095623110/10153195639343111/?type=3","334095623110_10153195639343111","The Harry Potter Alliance added a new photo to the album: HPA10.",317,3,33,2015-09-10 15:04:37,"2015-09","2015","Thursday","15:04",15,"12PM to 3PM",225,3375,"15"

Read the press release: 

Hermione Granger, Luna Lovegood Announce Entrance Into 2016 Presidential Race

Providence, Rhode Island - Are you ready for Hermione? If not, you might want to begin preparing yourself for the greatest political coup of all time. 

At a press conference held on the front steps of Brown University’s student center, Hermione Granger announced her candidacy for President of the United States of America. 

“I am running for witches,” she proclaimed. “I am running for muggle women. I am running for all oppressed peoples and magical creatures. I am running because you deserve a candidate who’ll buck politics as usual and bring a little more magic to the White House.”

In a legitimate first for any political campaign, Granger went on to provide extensive details regarding her policy positions, as well as concrete plans for achieving her goals. Granger was less specific when asked about how she’s eligible for the United States presidency without being a US Citizen. 

“I found a loophole,” she said enigmatically before changing the subject. “You can read more about my campaign by creating an account on my app, Grangr. All the wizard kids are using it.” 

Granger also took a moment to plug her campaign’s merchandise, which is being sold exclusively in a bundle via the Harry Potter Alliance’s 10th anniversary fundraiser at HPA10.com. The bundle includes a Granger/Lovegood 2016 t-shirt, a campaign sign, an iron-on patch, and a Ready for Hermione bumper sticker.

Granger was joined by running mate Luna Lovegood, who became distracted mid-announcement when she claimed a horse-mounted university cop was a thestral. She grabbed the microphone from Granger and asked if anyone else could see it. When everyone responded that they could, in fact, see the police horse, she began hugging everyone in the audience and expressing sympathy for their losses.

“I guess awkward sympathy hugs are the new baby hugs,” muttered Granger under her breath.

Many campus groups showed up in support of Granger’s announcement, but none were as boisterous and enthusiastic as Brown University’s Feminist Majority. Members of the group held up signs reading Granger Is Our Queen and Trample Deez Nuts -- either a reference to the mysterious candidate currently polling at 9% in North Carolina or a jab at the patriarchy in general.

"925","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","We are stunned and saddened by the tragic passing of Jake Brewer, an extraordinary civic leader, activist, visionary, photographer, triathlete, friend, husband, and father. 

Jake was hit by oncoming traffic while participating in a charity bike ride in support of a friend with cancer. He leaves behind his wife Mary Katharine Ham, their daughter Georgia, and a baby on the way. We are sending all of our love to his family in this unthinkably difficult time.

Jake had recently left his post as the head of global policy and external affairs at Change.Org to work as the Senior Technology Advisor at the White House. His resume spans far longer and more impressively than most thirty-four year olds’ and he was often behind the scenes of profound moments we all know - most recently he helped ensure fourteen year-old Ahmed Mohamed’s story was heard around the nation.

Jake was a friend, collaborator, and mentor to many in the Harry Potter Alliance. He did everything he could to get the HPA's name out there and he truly believed in us. While working as the strategic communications director for U.S. Ignite and as a partner of the new media firm Fission Strategy, Jake co-founded Define American with his best friend, Jose Antonio Vargas. Define American strives to shift the narrative surrounding immigration and has been the HPA’s leading partner in our immigration work over the years. Jake was instrumental in orchestrating our Superman Is An Immigrant campaign and was one of the unseen players advising our team when our volunteer staffer Julian Gomez publicly came out as undocumented. 

Far beyond his accomplishments, Jake was a brilliant, compassionate, energetic, and loving individual. He truly lit up any room he was in with his humor and authenticity. To leave the way he did - biking in a charity race - is an almost fitting, though tragic, conclusion to his brief life. He left while doing something he loved in support of others.

Speaking on Jake’s passing, President Obama said “I am heartbroken… Simply put, Jake was one of the best.” The world will be a different place without Jake Brewer, but we are privileged to have been a part of it with him for the short time that we were.

Please join us in remembering Jake and sending love to his family, friends, and the millions of people whom he impacted. If you would like to help, you can donate to the memorial education fund set up for his children: https://www.gofundme.com/p54ggr8g

Shootings should be unthinkable, not expected. We must prioritize and protect human lives, not that designed to end them.

We know it's difficult to feel anything but helplessness in times like these. We know it's difficult to look upon the stark lack of change in the wake of these startlingly frequent tragedies and not feel deeply discouraged. But we cannot become complacent; the stakes are too high to let our world's death eaters win. As we have seen time and time again, change happens because of people who dig their heels in and keep their voices loud and steady even - and especially - when the powerful demand their silence. 

Never underestimate how powerful you are and can be. When the high walls guarding the guilty seem impermeable, our hearts and voices are all we have. Do not let them tell you that this is not enough to move mountains. It always, always will be.

For example: among our many big plans for the next year alone, we will be launching a major campaign to fight institutionalized bullying against trans people.

Marriage equality was a huge victory, but people in LGBTQIA communities need much more. Many LGBTQIA people face legal discrimination in the workplace and in public spaces, often under the guise of religious freedom. We’re happy and humbled to have contributed to the fight for same-sex marriage, but we understand that there is so much more to be done in the fight for equality. 

Earlier this year, our Communications Director and Spokesperson Jackson Bird came out as trans, reaching tens of thousands of people from other trans youth to Eddie Redmayne. Jack’s leadership and perspective will be instrumental as we tackle trans issues.

This trans rights campaign will be our next step in this crucial movement: we will launch a major campaign to fight the legalized discrimination and institutionalized bullying that impacts trans people across the United States and beyond. 

Our current tenth birthday fundraiser will fund our next year of operation; it ends soon and is still aways from its goal.

Christopher Columbus’ “discovery” of America was followed by the genocide and enslavement of tens of millions of native people. His actions led to the transatlantic slave trade and centuries of violence and discrimination towards indigenous people.

We applaud those cities that have made the recent shift away from Columbus Day, as well as Berkeley for first making the change in the early nineties. It is our hope that these are the first of many.

Last year, you showed us that economic inequality isn’t a theme from the dystopian future - it’s a system we’re all living in. When Peacekeepers beat civilians in the streets, we recognize that Panem isn’t just a vision of some distant future. When the mayor of District 12 tells of a world ravaged by climate change, we know it’s more than a story on a page.  When Katniss struggles with PTSD without adequate resources, it’s a reflection of the problems we’re already facing. The effects of economic inequality are everywhere, from our homes and neighborhoods to the furthest corners of the world.

But the Hunger Games didn’t just hold a mirror to the worst of our world. It championed rebellion and revolution. It reminded us that big change is possible - that it only happens when we act on our power.

Katniss Everdeen struggled with economic inequality and seemingly impossible odds, but she never gave up. When she got the chance to fight back, she encouraged the whole world to join her. We recognize that same heroism in you. For the past two years, we’ve worked to create discussion and change around economic inequality through our Odds In Our Favor campaign. Now, as the final Hunger Games movie approaches, we’re going bigger than ever before. Are you in?

We want to hear your full #MyHungerGames stories: your real life struggles with inequality, and how you're fighting back. We’ll be sharing your stories on myhungergames.org.

We've also partnered with a coalition of rebel organizations who are all taking action to end economic inequality. Whether you're passionate about mental health, climate change, prison reform, racial justice, or more, we have tons of actions to help you dive in, make a difference, and join the revolution. 

The Hunger Games movies may be ending, but the story we're writing - the story of a more just and equal world - continues. Help us write it - until the odds are in everyone’s favor.","2015-10-20T14:23:47+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/thehpalliance/photos/a.10150643300388111.388909.334095623110/10153264660608111/?type=3","334095623110_10153264660608111","The Harry Potter Alliance updated their cover photo.",98,1,19,2015-10-20 10:23:47,"2015-10","2015","Tuesday","10:23",10,"8AM to 11AM",100,1000,"10"
"863","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","A message from our Executive Director regarding devastating news from the Harry Potter community:

Today, the Harry Potter fandom is mourning the loss of one of our most dedicated members, Dante Salvatierra, who passed away after a long battle with brain cancer.

About a year ago, Dante posted the following on facebook:

“Today might be the day they tell me that I only have x months on Earth. They don’t know that I love math and that x can mean anything. They also don’t know that my middle name means warrior. My last means save the earth. Not finished with this war. Not done saving your asses.”

I couldn’t possibly produce words that better exemplify who Dante was and the incredible personality and heart that he shared with the world around him. Dante exemplified what the wizard rock community is all about: he was exceedingly generous, his enthusiasm was boundless, and he was unwaveringly kind. He traveled great distances to attend wizard rock shows and Harry Potter conferences. He put himself out to organize shows when bands came through Omaha. He threw his full support behind every band that took the stage, no matter how big or small. He danced through every set and his joy lit up the room.

When events become legendary within a community, most of the credit is given to the performers and the organizers – but it’s the fans who truly make these events amazing and life-altering for everyone involved. I can’t think about events like Wrockstock and Hallows & Horcruxes without thinking of Dante. Fans like him were the heart and soul of those concerts. His presence and attitude made us all feel more at home and inspired us to treat each other with kindness and respect. Dante embodied the spirit and values of positive fandom, and in doing so he made our fandom a better place.

I am so grateful for you, Dante, and I wish you the best of luck in your next big adventure.

May we all aspire to be a little more like you.

Love,

"861","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","Just as the children of Panem are thrown into the Hunger Games while adults are safe, many youth are jailed for nonviolent offenses that would not be considered criminal if they were adults. The United States incarcerates children at a higher rate than any other developed nation. Many of these young people will spend time in solitary confinement, where they are denied human contact, fresh air, and more.

In Panem, many teens spend their time in the arena alone, fearful and in need of aid. Those that survive deal with PTSD, depression, anxiety and other forms of mental illness. Yet, for 74 years, no one spoke up. We CAN speak up for the seventy percent of children behind bars in our world struggling with mental health. We can decrease that number by fighting for youth justice.

Fusion and their Prison Kids documentary is taking a small first step by working to ban solitary confinement for minors. You can sign their petition and learn more by watching the documentary here: http://fusion.net/series/prison-kids/

"860","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","Jabriera’s #MyHungerGames story is about dealing with oppression and advocating for change.  

Jabriera grew up in Baltimore, Maryland. When she was 16, she got into an argument with her grandmother. As Jabriera’s grandmother was disciplining her, Jabriera tried to get her off her. Jabriera left the house, and later that day her grandmother died of a heart attack because of the argument. She was tried as an adult for second degree murder, second degree assault and first degree assault. When she went to court for a hearing, she was two days away from turning 18, so she plead guilty to the charges for fear of the trial dragging out longer and her punishment being worse. She was taken to a juvenile facility initially where she received resources such as education, group time, and mental health help. This was short lived however. She later was taken to an adult facility where she had to shower with women twice her age and was shamelessly exposed to a squat and cough in front of everyone while menstruating. She was placed on lockdown three times, once for misconduct, once with no reason, and the last time was because of a fight. The last lockdown was supposed to last two weeks but ended up being 36 days. When in lockdown, there was no contact with prison staff, only being housed in the same area as other inmates.

When she was released she was denied many opportunities. She asked for vouchers for food and services that other inmates receive upon release, but she was denied those too because felons don’t receive them. She wanted to attend University of Baltimore College, but was automatically rejected due to her felony charges. She had no place to stay. Then she met the Just Kids Maryland Campaign who assisted her and worked to get her record expunged. Now she works with Just Kids as an Assistant Youth Organizer where she has been working for four years. Now she works to share the stories of other youth such as herself because she knows too well that the issue of youth incarcerated as adults needs to be addressed. While also being a single mother of a 2-year old, she has been a mentor to youth and has been an advocate and a catalyst for change.

"855","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","We can change the Pine Ridge Reservation's #MyHungerGames story. Some words from the Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation:

""Each generation of Native youth has had the “odds stacked against them.” Those challenges look different for each passing generation, yet they share common threads. Our lands, water and families are still at risk from a value and development system that is very different from the traditions tribal community call their own.

We know ourselves to be of the land, not conquerors of it. We know that water is not infinite and not something to own, but should be protected as one would protect and love the eldest matriarch of one’s own family. The strength and quality of our character and the acts of good towards others are the currency our people use. While governments and others try to buy our land and sell our culture, no amount of money can take away our integrity—we are resilient and we will continue to work for our people and for the Earth.

The young people in our programs at Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation, where I work on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, show great courage. Some of our young people are taking important risks and uplifting themselves so that they can uplift others improve the quality of life for all. They are involved in internships, skills building, and moving our people along on a pathway out of poverty.

The way we see it, by empowering young people to direct their own future; by building capacity locally; by addressing the worlds biggest social, environmental and economic issues and disparities in one of the most significant places of struggle; we are disrupting the status quo and overcoming the negative statistics that big media companies like to use to sell their papers. We have survived colonization, genocide and we will continue to not only survive, but thrive. This represents the true culture of Lakota people.

Do not be fooled by the media or by the history books, the movement is here and the time is now. We need allies who see the truth and to partner with us in the face of adversity as we forge our own, bright future.""

After using a story about inequality to sell makeup, high-end cars, and even sandwiches, marketers have released their worst idea yet: a Hunger Games theme park. 

What could a theme park of a dystopian world possibly look like? We have some ideas…                           

    - Ride the Student Debt Rollercoaster: it just keeps going up!                   
    - A carnival-style Guess Your Salary! game where the staff always know to guess 25% less for women.          
    - No need for a First Aid Station, sick park goers can just ignore it and hope it goes away!
    - Citizens with papers, enjoy your complimentary Fast Passes! Undocumented immigrants and refugees, please form an unending queue outside the gates.

Got more theme park suggestions for Lionsgate? Let's hear them! Post them here or on twitter using the #MyHungerGames tag or submit them to MyHungerGames.Org 

We don’t need a Hunger Games theme park because, in many ways, we already live in Panem. This is our reality. Let's tell Lionsgate loud and clear: we don't want to build a theme park.

"838","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","This weekend, we're introducing you to our incredible Granger Leadership Academy keynote speakers. First up: Meghan Tonjes.

Meghan would give any so-called Renaissance man a run for his money. Whether she’s performing gorgeous original music, recording breathtaking covers, speaking difficult truths in honest videos, calling injustices for what they are, laying down the law 140 characters at a time, or leading body positivity movements (#BootyRevolution), Meghan kills it time after time. Her bold wisdom empowers people - from her regular viewers and the communities she’s a part of to readers of the countless international publications that have covered her work - every day.

We’re thrilled to welcome her to the Granger Leadership Academy this March. Between her online voice and her game-changing presence on panels at events like GeekyCon and VidCon, we already know she’ll have incredible things to say.

GLA is a place for people like Meghan, whether they’re accomplished professionals or young students. We welcome your voice, no matter how small or how loud, and we can’t wait to show you how far it can go.

GLA will take place on March 3rd-6th 2016 in Warwick, Rhode Island.

The weapon we have is love. ❤️⚡️","2015-11-14T00:47:32+0000","status",NA,"334095623110_10153304432733111",NA,1404,19,59,2015-11-13 19:47:32,"2015-11","2015","Friday","19:47",19,"4PM to 7PM",361,6859,"19"
"836","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","We are with you: processing, grieving, baffled, shattered, grasping desperately for light.

Here is what we know: unspeakable harm was done to Paris tonight; unspeakable harm will be done to people of Muslim faith and people of color by people who take advantage of tragedy to act on their hatred; people across the world - ourselves among them - are shaken to their very core; this is not the first time; we cannot say it will be the last time.

And so much of this feels intensely personal.

It seems that the list of safe spaces torn apart by violence grows every year: schools, movie theaters, schools again, places of worship, places of community, venues for live music. We grow up hearing that stories are escapes only to find demons in our safest havens.

And so we cannot blame those whose lists of personal safe spaces narrow in parallel. Your feelings are valid, your reaction is valid, and we urge you to follow your gut, to seek what safety means for you.

But if you feel safest in the very places terrorists - in Paris, in Columbine, in Aurora, in Newton, in Charleston, and on and on and on - have devastated, know you have not lost them. If anger boils in your stomach, know nothing can come from meeting their hatred with your own. The most powerful thing we can do every time we move forward from unthinkable loss is to hold on to love and to hold on to what we love.

This is not easy. But it is so important.

The places we love - movie theaters at midnight, libraries where books changed our lives, venues where we sang late into the night - have given us not just entertainment, but spaces to make sense of the world, spaces to make sense of ourselves, crowds to be distinctly and lastingly unalone in, lifelong friendships, lifelong magic, homes to carry with us.

We cannot and will not let them take any of this from us.

Here is how we move forward: keep loving; keep fighting; celebrate story; laugh, dance, sing - with your friends, with strangers, with every single person who keeps showing up when the world tells them not to; resist hatred; resist cynicism; know none of this is foolish; know that it is necessary; protect and defend those who - not for the first time - will be victims of hatred falsely carried out in the name of justice; give love and light to those around you and those around the world; be excellent to each other; be good.

Always, always, always: the weapon we have is love.","2015-11-14T01:58:07+0000","status",NA,"334095623110_10153304525478111",NA,2920,58,1066,2015-11-13 20:58:07,"2015-11","2015","Friday","20:58",20,"8PM to 11PM",400,8000,"20"

The Harry Potter Alliance’s fan activist con will take place this spring. We spoke to conference organizer and all-around badass Janae Phillips about what makes it different and - yes - magical:

HPA: What is GLA? 

JP: GLA is a training ground for our world’s heroes. 

The GLA experience takes everything the HPA values - creativity, unironic enthusiasm, the importance of stories, and the power of anyone to become a hero - and wraps it all into an immersive leadership conference.

How has your experience with traditional leadership conferences shaped you? How will GLA be different?

JP: I’m of the opinion that if leadership education is boring you’re doing it so, so wrong. You know when things advertise themselves as a “resume booster” before anything else? Yeah, that means they couldn’t think of a good reason you’d want to do that but they want you to do it anyway. 

I studied leadership programs and was involved in both running and attending a lot of leadership workshops and conferences. I often found myself frustrated with the fact that many traditional formats can feel like hours of lectures, and there was very little attention paid to building an experience out of the event. A lot of times you leave these events not entirely sure how all of that information fit into your own development as a leader. Plus, there was often a disproportionate number of older white males around. 

GLA is built to turn those traditions on their head - to put attendees and their journey in the center of everything we do, to make the experience as fun as a fandom con, and to give the power of mentorship and teaching to a diversity of voices that actually represents our communities.

HPA: What do you hope attendees will come back with?

JP: I hope that they leave GLA feeling like they learned so much more about themselves, feeling empowered to go back to their communities and be leaders, and with a couple new friends.

HPA:You can pull any fictional character out of their respective worlds and bring them to GLA. Which do you choose? Why?

JP: Oh boy. I’d love to hear what Korra would have to say about leadership. She developed and grew so much as a leader herself, I think she’d have a lot to say on the subject. And she’d just be fun to have around.

"778","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","This is what we’re about. The idea that story can change the world is at the heart of what we do and how we do it.

But before we were building an organization, planning campaigns, or sharing in the power of story and the power of love with a community built on both, we were reading and watching Harry Potter. We were being enchanted by actors like Alan Rickman, who brought our very favorite story to life with incomparable commitment and skill. To think about the films is to think about that inimitable sneer, that drawl nobody can ever unhear.

Those performances and their impact never faded. In the past month alone, we’ve seen references to Alan Rickman’s Snape in puppet shows and lyrics, from Yule Balls to Draco and the Malfoys’ house show. And in the years before that? Too many good times to count. We don’t think Alan could possibly know exactly how many or exactly how grateful we are.

The truest thing Severus Snape ever said was simple: “It’s real for us.” It all is: the message, the memories, the magic. The best way to move forward is to carry that with us.

If that first potions scene struck fear - or anger - into your heart, if Alan Rickman’s immaculate portrayal made you feel something, to want to do something, to want to be kinder and to never abuse your power over those in your care and to stick it to the man, that was real. It is real. The power of a community coming together in a time of darkness and creating light is real, too. Don’t lose sight of it. Use it to change the world.","2016-01-14T15:55:52+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/thehpalliance/photos/a.10150112250908111.280078.334095623110/10153422237228111/?type=3","334095623110_10153422237228111","The Harry Potter Alliance with Bettina Gabriela Sanchez and 5 others.",18169,167,3658,2016-01-14 10:55:52,"2016-01","2016","Thursday","10:55",10,"8AM to 11AM",100,1000,"10"

"776","334095623110","The Harry Potter Alliance","As we observe Martin Luther King Jr. Day, we must take time to reflect and commit ourselves to progressive, compassionate change.

This holiday is, yes, one to celebrate - a day to consider the triumphs of the Civil Rights movements, the revolutionary contributions of black activists and artists, the story of everything that has led to today. But that cannot be all that it is. We cannot welcome the false sense of achievement we’ve been taught to slip into on the third Monday of every January. To do so would be to discredit the daily demonstrations demanding basic rights, deny the dangerous failings of the system, and diminish the mourning that weighs on communities that have come to know the realities of racism all too well.

We must regard today with solace and solemnity rather than with victory. And we must keep moving forward.

We must listen to firsthand accounts of oppression and marginalization. We must allow these stories to inform our worldview and advocacy. We must advocate vocally, but never speak for or over the people we seek to help. We must speak and act with compassion, conscious of the power and privilege we carry. We must strive to educate ourselves. We must demand equality consistently and completely.

We must do these things in King’s memory, yes, but also in Mike Brown’s, in Tamir Rice’s, in Sandra Bland's - the list, to our great sorrow, goes on. And we must do these things with the urgent hope that together we can shift the tides and create a tomorrow where this is no longer our normal.

In his book recounting the Montgomery bus boycott, King wrote: “Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. Even a superficial look at history reveals that no social advance rolls in on the wheels inevitability. Every step towards the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering, and struggle; the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals. […] This is no time for apathy or complacency. This is a time for vigorous and positive action.”","2016-01-18T19:27:03+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/thehpalliance/photos/a.10150112250908111.280078.334095623110/10153430271413111/?type=3","334095623110_10153430271413111",NA,304,1,38,2016-01-18 14:27:03,"2016-01","2016","Monday","14:27",14,"12PM to 3PM",196,2744,"14"

Every year, we go back to basics for our longest running campaign: Accio Books. In the dawning hours of our organization, we built the Harry Potter Alliance on the idea that story and the people who believe in it can change the world. For over ten years, this has remained the foundation of everything we do.

We know story is powerful, so it follows that we believe story should be accessible. Through Accio Books, our global community comes together to celebrate story, fight for literary access, and collect books which are then distributed to underserved populations. Our sixth Accio Books campaign is just around the corner – we can’t wait.

But first, we need your help.

Today, our second Friends of the Apparating Library fundraiser kicks off.

The money raised will allow us to coordinate a book drive spanning several continents, provide essential resources to our members and chapters, support events in honor of World Book Night in three cities, advocate to Congress for increased support for public libraries, and build a brand new library in Masaka, Uganda.","2016-03-17T18:14:59+0000","link","https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/friends-of-the-apparating-library-2016#/","334095623110_10153555573598111",NA,33,2,11,2016-03-17 14:14:59,"2016-03","2016","Thursday","14:14",14,"12PM to 3PM",196,2744,"14"

Representation is so vital to helping us figure out our identities and how we want to exist in the world.

Sometimes we all need a reminder that resistance is worth it. Making calls, attending protests and town halls, running for office, and being a voice for change is vital - but it can also be draining. Today, help the movement by showing an activist some love and helping them stay in the fight.

How can you show love to someone fighting for change?

→ Write them a message of support, saying what you admire about them and the work they have been doing

→ Give them a call to talk about how rad they are and what you can do to help their campaign

→ Make a donation in their name to the HPA or another organization they care about

Both were appointed with no experience in public education, neither know much about how students learn, and both favor a dangerous political agenda over what is best for students and schools. We want to encourage Secretary DeVos to do better than her fictional counterpart, and to remind her that when Headmasters don’t listen, they don’t get to stay in power.

So this weekend, #DecorateLikeDolores and serve up some resistance on a cat plate. There's two great options:

1. Owl Post: Download our postcards, grab a stamp, and mail them right to the U.S. Department of Education.

2. Social Media: Use our postcards, or google an image of your fav cat plate. Tweet @BetsyDeVos, telling her what you want her to do in office, and include your cat plate pic. Be sure to tag it #DecorateLikeDolores. We'll be watching & retweeting our favs all weekend!

Will cat plates change the world? As awesome as that would be, probably not. But we have instructions from Fred & George.

Flint residents still do not have clean water, and you can help by donating *and* urging lawmakers to act: helpforflint.com/action

In Canada, First Nations communities are pushing for funding & control after years of unsafe water: http://www.amnesty.ca/our-work/issues/indigenous-peoples/indigenous-peoples-in-canada/the-right-to-water

In Kenya, Ghana, & Nigeria, activists are organizing around mining, water waste, & habitat destruction: http://350africa.org/world-water-day-water-impacted-communities-spearheading-solutions/

#StandingRock Water Protectors & supporters (pictured) are still fighting for environmental & cultural preservation by pushing for #NoDAPL. You can support the movement: http://standwithstandingrock.net 

At worldwaterday.org, the United Nations is working to make sure communities around the world have access to clean water.

Around the world, women of color are leading the fight for clean water and climate action: https://thinkprogress.org/women-are-the-ones-fighting-the-tough-environmental-battles-around-the-world-ed3c3a0e09e2#.s1395buyi

For muggles and wizards alike, water is life.
