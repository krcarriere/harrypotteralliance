In high school I helped co-found a chapter of STAND (Students Taking Action Now: Darfur) to raise awareness and funds to stop the genocide taking place in Darfur, Sudan. I continued working with STAND chapters throughout college. I participated in Christian missions trips, volunteered in the community, joined the board of a local youth suicide prevention non-profit (and became their artistic director) and now I work full-time for a sexual violence prevention nonprofit. It's always been an integral part of who I am to try and help those around me, in the best way I can. I'm introverted so I don't network a lot, I don't give public speeches or organize events. But I love using graphic design to help organizations create a brand, have a professional image, reach their audiences, and raise funds for the important work they do.","","","Probably being more involved specifically with the HPA.
